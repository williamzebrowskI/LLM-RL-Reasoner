What is the rate of interest per annum?', 'rationale': \"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concepts of Compound Interest (C.I.) and Simple Interest (S.I.).\\n\\nThe formula for calculating C.I. is:\\n\\nA = P(1 + r/100)^n\\n\\nwhere A is the amount after n years, P is the principal amount, r is the rate of interest per annum, and n is the number of years.\\n\\nThe formula for calculating S.I. is:\\n\\nS.I. = (P * r * n) / 100\\n\\nGiven that the difference between C.I. and S.I. on an amount of $10,000 for 2 years is $36, we can set up the following equation:\\n\\n[C.I. - S.I.] = 36\\n\\nSubstituting the formulas for C.I. and S.I., we get:\\n\\n[P(1 + r/100)^n - (P * r * n) / 100] = 36\\n\\nSimplifying the equation, we can substitute P = $10,000, n = 2, and solve for r.\\n\\nFirst, let's calculate C.I. and S.I. separately:\\n\\nC.I. = $10,000(1 + r/100)^2\\nS.I. = ($10,000 * r * 2) / 100\\n\\nNow, substitute these values into the equation:\\n\\n[$10,000(1 + r/100)^2 - ($10,000 * r * 2) / 100] = 36\\n\\nSimplify and solve for r.\\n\\n$10,000((1 + r/100)^2 - (r/50)) = 36\\n\\n[(1 + r/100)^2 - (r/50)] = 3.6 / 1000\\n\\n(1 + r/100)^2 - (r/50) = 0.0036\\n\\nThis equation is difficult to solve algebraically, so let's simplify it further by making a substitution:\\n\\nLet x = r/100\\n\\nThen the equation becomes:\\n\\n(1 + x)^2 - 2x = 0.00036\\n\\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\\n\\n1 + 2x + x^2 - 2x = 0.00036\\n\\nCombine like terms:\\n\\nx^2 + 1 = 0.00036\\n\\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\\n\\nx^2 = -0.99964\\n\\nSince the square of any real number cannot be negative, there is no solution for x.\\n\\nHowever, since the original equation involves a difference of C.I. and S.I., we can try another approach.\\n\\nRecall that the formula for calculating the difference between C.I. and S.I. is:\\n\\n[C.I. - S.I.] = (P * r^2 * n / 100) / (1 + r/100)\\n\\nSubstitute the values into this equation:\\n\\n[$10,000 * r^2 * 2 / 100] / [1 + r/100] = 36\\n\\nSimplify and solve for r.\\n\\n$20,000r^2 / (100 + r) = 3600\\n\\nCross-multiply:\\n\\n20000r^2 = 3600(100 + r)\\n\\nExpand and simplify:\\n\\n20000r^2 = 360000 + 3600r\\n\\nSubtract 3600r from both sides:\\n\\n20000r^2 - 3600r = 360000\\n\\nDivide the entire equation by 20 to simplify it further:\\n\\n1000r^2 - 180r = 18000\\n\\nDivide the entire equation by 10 to make it easier to solve:\\n\\n100r^2 - 18r = 1800\\n\\nRearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation:\\n\\n100r^2 - 18r - 1800 = 0\\n\\nNow we have a quadratic equation that can be solved using the quadratic formula.\\n\\nThe discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is:\\n\\n(-18)^2 - 4(100)(-1800)\\n\\n= 324 + 720000\\n\\n= 720324\\n\\nThe square root of the discriminant is:\\n\\n√720324 ≈ 2683.52\\n\\nNow, apply the quadratic formula to find r:\\n\\nr = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)\\n\\nSubstitute a = 100, b = -18, and c = -1800 into the formula.\\n\\nr = [(-(-18)) ± √((-18)^2 - 4(100)(-1800))] / (2 * 100)\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\nr = (18 ± √720324) / 200\\n\\nApproximate r to two decimal places:\\n\\nr ≈ (18 + 16.24) / 200 or (18 - 16.24) / 200\\n\\nChoose the positive value for interest rate, so we have:\\n\\nr ≈ 33.24 / 200\\nr ≈ 0.1662\\n\\nMultiply this by 100 to convert it back to percentage form.\\n\\nThe final answer is:\", 'answer': 'No Answer Extracted'}\n",

Therefore, there are 7 possibilities for this step.\\n\\nStep 2: Choosing a main course\\nThere are 5 different main courses to choose from. Therefore, there are 5 possibilities for this step.\\n\\nStep 3: Choosing two desserts\\nThere are 6 different desserts to choose from, and customers want to choose two different desserts.

Therefore, the number of possible combinations for choosing two desserts is C(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 15.\\n\\nNow that we have calculated the possibilities for each step, we can multiply them together to find the total number of different meals possible: 7 * 5 * 15 = 525.\\n\\nTherefore, there are a total of 525 different meals possible.\\n\\nAnswer: 525',\n",
