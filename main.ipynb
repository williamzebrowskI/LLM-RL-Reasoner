This is because we assumed that the interest is compounded annually, but the question doesn't specify this.\\n\\nLet's try another approach using compound interest formula (since it's not specified to be simple interest):\\n\\nAmount after 3 years = P × (1 + R)^T\\n\\nUsing the original rate of interest (5.29%), we get:\\n\\nA = 825 × (1 + 0.0529)^3\\n≈ Rs. 1055\\n\\nThis is the amount that would become in 3 years if the interest is compounded annually.\\n\\nSo, the correct answer is:\\n\\nC: Rs. 1055\", 'answer': 'C'}\n"
