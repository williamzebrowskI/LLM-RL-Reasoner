The points s, x, y, and z are on a number line and satisfy the condition s > x > y > z.\\n2. y is halfway between x and z, which means that the average of their positions is equal to y.\\n3. x is halfway between w and z, which means that the average of their positions is equal to x.\\n\\nFrom the second point, we know that (y + z) / 2 = y, as y is the midpoint between x and z. This simplifies to z = 0.\\n\\nUsing this result in the third point, we get (x + z) / 2 = x, which means z is already zero. Thus, s > x > y > 0.\\n\\nNow let's focus on the first condition: w is not given explicitly but can be deduced by considering that x is the midpoint between w and z. Since z = 0, we have (w + 0) / 2 = x, which simplifies to w = 2x.\\n\\nWe also know that y is halfway between x and z, so y = x/2.\\n\\nSince s > x, and y = x/2, it follows that s > x > y/2. This implies that s - y/2 > 0 or (s - y)/2 > 0.\\n\\nNow we want to find the ratio of y - x to y - s. By substituting the values for y in terms of x and simplifying, we get:\\n\\n(y - x) / (y - s) = (x/2 - x) / ((3x)/4 - s)\\n\\nSince z = 0, s > x > y > z implies that s - x > 0. Multiplying both sides by 4 gives us 4s - 4x > 0.\\n\\nWe have (y - x) / (y - s) = (-x/2) / ((3x)/4 - s). Factoring out a 2 and simplifying the denominator, we get:\\n\\n(y - x) / (y - s) = -x / [2(3x - 4s)]\\n\\nCombining like terms in the numerator, we have -x = (-1/2)x. Plugging this into our previous expression gives us:\\n\\n(y - x) / (y - s) = (-1/2)x / [-3x + 8s]\\n\\nSimplifying by dividing out an x, we get:\\n\\n(y - x) / (y - s) = -(1/2) / [(-3)/4 + (8/s)]\\n\\nTo divide the numerator and denominator by -2 to simplify further,\\n\\n(y - x) / (y - s) = 1/2 * [-4/-6 - 16/s]\\n\\nUsing the property that a/b * c/d = ac/bd,\\n\\n(y - x) / (y - s) = [(-4s + 48)/(-24)]\\n\\nTo simplify this expression, we can divide out an s and use the property from above again to get:\\n\\n(y - x) / (y - s) = 1/6 * (-4 + 48/s)\\n\\nThis simplifies further to\\n\\n(y - x) / (y - s) = [(-4*24)/48] + 8/s\\n\\n\\nNow, multiplying and dividing the right-hand side by 24 to get rid of the fractions inside the brackets,\\n\\n(y - x) / (y - s) = (-96/48) + 2/s\\n\\n\\nSimplifying both sides further gives us\\n\\n(y - x) / (y - s) = -2 + 2/s\\n\\n\\nFinally, factoring out a negative sign and combining like terms in the numerator, we get:\\n\\n(y - x) / (y - s) = [-(2 - 2/s)].\\n\\n\\nUsing the rule from above once more to eliminate the fraction inside the brackets,\\n\\n\\n(y - x) / (y - s) = (-2)/1 + 2/s\\n\\n\\nSimplifying both sides further by multiplying and dividing the numerator and denominator, respectively, by 4 gives us:\\n\\n(y - x) / (y - s) = [(-8 + 8/s)]/4\\n\\n\\nUsing the rule from above once more to eliminate fractions inside the brackets,\\n(y - x) / (y - s) = (-8)/4 + 2/s\\n\\n\\nNow combining like terms, we have\\n\\n(y - x) / (y - s) = [-2 + 1/(s/2)].\\n\\n\\nFinally, factoring out a negative sign and using the rule from above to eliminate fractions inside the brackets, we get:\\n\\n(y - x)/(y - s) = (-2 + 1/s)/1\\n\\n\\nMultiplying both numerator and denominator by -1 to remove the minus signs,\\n\\n\\n(y - x) / (y - s) = (-2 + 2/s)/-1\\n\\n\\nSimplifying both sides further by factoring out a 2 from the numerator, we get:\\n\\n(y - x)/(y - s) = [(-2 + 2/s)]/-1\\n\\n\\nFinally, combining like terms in the numerator and simplifying, we have:\\n\\n\\n(y - x)/(y - s) = [-2] / [-1 + (1/s)].\\n\\n\\nSimplifying both sides further by multiplying and dividing the numerator and denominator respectively by -s to get rid of the fractions inside the brackets,\\n\\n\\n(y - x) / (y - s) = [(-2*s)/(-s)] / [-s/s + 1]\\n\\n\\nNow, simplifying the expression on the right-hand side by canceling out common factors in both the numerator and denominator, we have:\\n\\n\\n(y - x)/(y - s) = (-2s) / (-s + (s/s))\\n\\n\\nSimplifying further,\\n\\n(y - x) / (y - s) = -2.\\n\\n\\nTherefore,\\n\\n(y - x)/(y - s) = -(1/2).\\n\\n\\nThus the ratio of y-x to y-s is 1/2.\\n \\nThus, the answer is $\\\\boxed{1/2}$.\", 'answer': 'No Answer Extracted'}\n",

Looking at the expression (1 + 66207)(1 - 66207), we can see that if we multiply the two factors, we will get an extremely large number.\\n\\nNow, since 4^2+ 4^4 + 4^8 is much smaller than the product of (1 + 66207) and (1 - 66207), let's consider a different approach:\\n\\nWe know that b must be much smaller than a. We also know that both a and b are integers.\\n\\nLooking at our previous calculations, we can see that 4^8 is extremely large compared to the other two terms.\\n\\nThe only reasonable factorization of this expression would involve large factors for (a+b) and small factors for (a-b).\\n\\nLet's consider an alternative way to write the expression:\\n\\n(a + b)(a - b) = 66208\\n\\nSince we know that a+b should be much larger than a-b, let's try to find two numbers whose sum is significantly larger than their difference.\\n\\nOne such pair could be: \\n\\n66000 and 208\\n\\nHere, a+b = 66000 + 208 = 66208\\na - b = 66000 - 208 = 65792\\n\\nHowever, since (a-b) should be much smaller than (a+b), we can try to increase the difference:\\n\\n66020 and 188\\n\\nNow, a+b = 66020 + 188 = 66208\\na - b = 66020 - 188 = 65832\\n\\nWe are getting close, but this is still not our pair.\\n\\nLet's consider another option: \\n\\n66100 and 208\\n\\nHere, a+b = 66100 + 208 = 66308 (which does not match the given expression), so we cannot use it.\\n\\nHowever, let's try: \\n\\n66080 and 228\\n\\nWe get: \\na+b = 66080 + 228 = 66308 (too large again), but wait...\\n\\nLet's consider a smaller number for (a-b). What if we choose:\\n\\n66010 and 298\\n\\nThen: \\na+b = 66010 + 298 = 66208\\na - b = 66010 - 298 = 65712\\n\\nThis pair looks promising! However, it still does not match our target.\\n\\nLet's try to increase the value of (a-b) even more:\\n\\n66050 and 258\\n\\nWe get: \\na+b = 66050 + 258 = 66208\\na - b = 66050 - 258 = 65792\\n\\nNow we are very close. But, let's not make any assumptions!\\n\\nOne last option is:\\n\\n66010 doesn't work; what if we try: \\n\\n66020 and the other number would be...?\\n\\n66000 + 208 = 66208\\n66000 - 208 = 65992\\n\\nYes! Now we have a pair that works. We should confirm this by checking whether the product of (1+26207) and (1-26207) matches our initial expression.\\n\\nIndeed, it does!\\n\\n(1 + 26207)(1 - 26207) = 26208* - 26206\\n\\nNow, let's simplify the right side:\\n\\n26208*(-26206) = 66208\\n\\nYay! We finally have our factorization!\\n\\nSince we were given that a and b are integers, we can now write:\\n\\n(a + b)(a - b) = (26208)(-26206)\\n\\nHere, a+b = 26208\\na-b = -26206\\n\\nFrom the equation above, we get:\\n\\nb = 26208/2\\n= 13104\\n\\nSo, the value of b is 13104.\\n\\nAnswer: 13104\", 'answer': '13104'}\n",

      "Incorrect: {'question': 'How many even multiples of 65 are there between 649 and 1301?', 'rationale': \"To find the number of even multiples of 65 between 649 and 1301, we need to follow these steps:\\n\\nStep 1: Find the smallest multiple of 65 that is greater than or equal to 650.\\n\\nThe first step is to divide 650 by 65. This will give us a quotient and a remainder. The quotient will be the smallest whole number that is less than or equal to the result, while the remainder will tell us how far off we are from having an exact multiple of 65.\\n\\n650 ÷ 65 = 10 with a remainder of 0\\n\\nThis tells us that 650 itself is a multiple of 65. However, since we're interested in even multiples and there's no information about including or excluding the endpoint (649), it seems reasonable to consider starting from the next even number after 650.\\n\\nThe smallest even multiple of 65 greater than or equal to 650 is therefore still 650 itself because it's an even multiple. \\n\\nStep 2: Find the largest multiple of 65 that is less than or equal to 1301.\\n\\nNow we divide 1301 by 65:\\n\\n1301 ÷ 65 = 20 with a remainder of 1\\n\\nThis tells us that the largest whole number multiple of 65 that is less than 1301 is 20 * 65, which equals 1300. Again, since we're looking for even multiples and this result comes from an exact division into whole numbers, it's also an even multiple.\\n\\nStep 3: Calculate how many multiples of 65 are between these two values.\\n\\nWe've identified the smallest (650) and largest (1300) even multiples within the given range. To find out how many multiples of 65 there are, we simply count them by finding how many times 65 fits into the difference between these two numbers:\\n\\n(1300 - 650)/65 = 650/65\\n\\nNow let's calculate that:\\n\\n650 ÷ 65 = 10 with a remainder of 0\\n\\nSo, since both endpoints (650 and 1300) are themselves multiples of 65, we include them in our count. Therefore, there are 10 multiples of 65 between 649 and 1301.\\n\\nSince the question asks specifically for even multiples, but every multiple of 65 is either odd or even, and our inclusion criteria allowed us to start counting from 650 (which is an even number), we don't need to exclude any multiples. Every multiple within this range will be even because we started counting from an even number.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is:\\n\\nAnswer: 10\", 'answer': '10'}\n",

If the company’s average revenue per customer per month is $100, then what percent of the company's revenue comes from customers with Plan A?\", 'rationale': \"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\\n\\nStep 1: Let's assume that the number of customers subscribing to Plan A is x and the number of customers subscribing to Plan B is y. We know that the total number of customers (x + y) multiplied by $100 (average revenue per customer per month) equals the total revenue for all customers, which can be expressed as $25x + $75y.\\n\\nStep 2: The equation from Step 1 is:\\n$100(x + y) = $25x + $75y\\nThis simplifies to:\\n$100x + $100y = $25x + $75y\\n\\nStep 3: To solve for x in terms of y, we can rearrange the equation by subtracting $25x and adding $75y to both sides. This yields:\\n$75x = -$25y\\n$x = -\\\\frac{25}{75}y$\\nSimplifying gives us:\\n$x = -\\\\frac{1}{3}y$\\n\\nStep 4: To find the ratio of customers subscribing to Plan A (x) to the total number of customers (x + y), we can substitute $-\\\\frac{1}{3}y$ for x in the expression (x + y). This gives us:\\nTotal Customers = $-\\\\frac{1}{3}y$ + y\\nSimplifying yields:\\nTotal Customers = $\\\\frac{2}{3}y$\\n\\nStep 5: The ratio of customers subscribing to Plan A is then given by the number of Plan A subscribers (x) divided by the total number of customers. Substituting $-\\\\frac{1}{3}y$ for x, we have:\\n$\\\\frac{x}{Total Customers}$ = $\\\\frac{-\\\\frac{1}{3}y}{\\\\frac{2}{3}y}$\\nSimplifying this expression gives us:\\n$\\\\frac{x}{Total Customers}$ = $-\\\\frac{1}{2}$\\n\\nStep 6: However, the negative sign is irrelevant in this context. We are interested in the percentage of customers subscribing to Plan A out of the total, so we take the absolute value of our ratio.\\n\\nTo convert this ratio into a percentage, we multiply by 100:\\n$\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{Total Customers}\\\\right) * 100 = \\\\left(-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right)*100$\\n\\nSimplifying yields:\\n\\n-50%\\n\\nSince percentages cannot be negative, and the problem is asking for the percent of revenue coming from customers with Plan A, we have misunderstood our calculation. The correct approach should consider that if x represents the number of customers on plan A, then y represents the customers on plan B.\\n\\nStep 7: Let’s re-evaluate Step 5 considering that a negative ratio doesn't apply here:\\nWe take the absolute value of $\\\\left(-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right)$ which is $\\\\frac{1}{2}$ and convert it into percentage by multiplying with 100.\\n\\nThe final answer is:\\nAnswer: 50%\", 'answer': '50%'}\n",

The points s, x, y, and z are on a number line and satisfy the condition s > x > y > z.\\n2. y is halfway between x and z, which means that the average of their positions is equal to y.\\n3. x is halfway between w and z, which means that the average of their positions is equal to x.\\n\\nFrom the second point, we know that (y + z) / 2 = y, as y is the midpoint between x and z. This simplifies to z = 0.\\n\\nUsing this result in the third point, we get (x + z) / 2 = x, which means z is already zero.

By substituting the values for y in terms of x and simplifying, we get:\\n\\n(y - x) / (y - s) = (x/2 - x) / ((3x)/4 - s)\\n\\nSince z = 0, s > x > y > z implies that s - x > 0.

This will give us a quotient and a remainder. The quotient will be the smallest whole number that is less than or equal to the result, while the remainder will tell us how far off we are from having an exact multiple of 65.\\n\\n650 ÷ 65 = 10 with a remainder of 0\\n\\nThis tells us that 650 itself is a multiple of 65. However, since we're interested in even multiples and there's no information about including or excluding the endpoint (649), it seems reasonable to consider starting from the next even number after 650.\\n\\nThe smallest even multiple of 65 greater than or equal to 650 is therefore still 650 itself because it's an even multiple. \\n\\nStep 2: Find the largest multiple of 65 that is less than or equal to 1301.\\n\\nNow we divide 1301 by 65:\\n\\n1301 ÷ 65 = 20 with a remainder of 1\\n\\nThis tells us that the largest whole number multiple of 65 that is less than 1301 is 20 * 65, which equals 1300. Again, since we're looking for even multiples and this result comes from an exact division into whole numbers, it's also an even multiple.\\n\\nStep 3: Calculate how many multiples of 65 are between these two values.\\n\\nWe've identified the smallest (650) and largest (1300) even multiples within the given range. To find out how many multiples of 65 there are, we simply count them by finding how many times 65 fits into the difference between these two numbers:\\n\\n(1300 - 650)/65 = 650/65\\n\\nNow let's calculate that:\\n\\n650 ÷ 65 = 10 with a remainder of 0\\n\\nSo, since both endpoints (650 and 1300) are themselves multiples of 65, we include them in our count. Therefore, there are 10 multiples of 65 between 649 and 1301.\\n\\nSince the question asks specifically for even multiples, but every multiple of 65 is either odd or even, and our inclusion criteria allowed us to start counting from 650 (which is an even number), we don't need to exclude any multiples. Every multiple within this range will be even because we started counting from an even number.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is:\\n\\nAnswer: 10\",\n",

To find the percentage, we\\'ll divide this by the total number of arrangements and multiply by 100.\\n\\nPercentage = (240 / 720) * 100\\n\\nSimplifying:\\n\\n(240 / 720) = 1/3\\nMultiply by 100:\\n(1/3) * 100 = 33.33%\\n\\nTherefore, approximately 33% of the different arrangements of the letters in the word AJICUX are those in which the vowels appear together.\\n\\nAnswer:',\n",

Principal (P) = Rs. 825\\n2. Amount after 3 years (A) = Rs. 956\\n\\nWe need to find the rate of interest (R) at which P becomes A in 3 years. We'll use the formula for simple interest:\\n\\nSimple Interest (SI) = (P × R × T)/100\\n\\nwhere T is the time period, which is 3 years here.\\n\\nFirst, let's calculate the SI for the given scenario:\\n\\nA = P + SI\\n956 = 825 + (SI)\\nSI = 131\\n\\nNow, we can use the formula to find the rate of interest (R):\\n\\nSI = (P × R × T)/100\\n131 = (825 × R × 3)/100\\n131 = 24.75R\\nR = 131/24.75 ≈ 5.29%\\n\\nThis is the original rate of interest.\\n\\nNow, let's consider what happens when the rate of interest is increased by 4%:\\n\\nNew Rate (R') = Original Rate + Increase in Rate\\n= 5.29% + 4%\\n= 9.29%\\n\\nWe need to find the new amount that Rs. 825 will become in 3 years at this increased rate.\\n\\nUsing the simple interest formula, we can calculate the new SI:\\n\\nNew SI = (P × R' × T)/100\\n= (825 × 9.29% × 3)/100\\n= 23.61\\n\\nNow, add this new SI to the principal to find the new amount:\\n\\nNew Amount = P + New SI\\n= 825 + 23.61\\n≈ Rs. 848.61\\n\\nHowever, we're asked for a multiple-choice answer, and none of the options match our calculation. This is because we assumed that the interest is compounded annually, but the question doesn't specify this.\\n\\nLet's try another approach using compound interest formula (since it's not specified to be simple interest):\\n\\nAmount after 3 years = P × (1 + R)^T\\n\\nUsing the original rate of interest (5.29%), we get:\\n\\nA = 825 × (1 + 0.0529)^3\\n≈ Rs. 1055\\n\\nThis is the amount that would become in 3 years if the interest is compounded annually.\\n\\nSo, the correct answer is:\\n\\nC: Rs. 1055\", 'answer': 'C'}\n"
