One-third of all the participants are Democrats. How many of the Democrats are female?', 'rationale': \"Let's break down the problem step by step:\\n\\n1. We know that half the female participants and one-quarter of the male participants are Democrats.\\n\\nLet F be the number of female participants and M be the number of male participants. Since there are 750 total participants, we can write an equation:\\n\\nF + M = 750\\n\\n2. According to the problem, half the female participants are Democrats, so the number of Democratic female participants is F/2.\\n\\nSimilarly, one-quarter of the male participants are Democrats, so the number of Democratic male participants is M/4.\\n\\n3. We are also told that one-third of all the participants are Democrats. This means that the total number of Democratic participants (both male and female) is 1/3 * 750 = 250.\\n\\nSince we know the number of Democratic participants comes from both male and female, we can write another equation:\\n\\nF/2 + M/4 = 250\\n\\nMultiplying this equation by 4 to get rid of the fractions gives us:\\n\\n2F + M = 1000\\n\\n4. We have two equations now: F + M = 750 (from step 1) and 2F + M = 1000 (from step 3).\\n\\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\\n\\n2F + M - (F + M) = 1000 - 750\\nF = 250\\n\\n5. Now that we know F, we can find M by substituting F into one of our earlier equations:\\n\\nF + M = 750\\n250 + M = 750\\nM = 500\\n\\n6. Finally, to find how many Democrats are female, we divide the number of Democratic females (F/2) by the total number of Democratic participants (250):\\n\\nNumber of Democratic females = F/2 = 250/2 = 125\\n\\nAnswer: 125\", 'answer': '125'}\n",

The expression y = 3x + 4 shows that y is obtained by adding 4 to the product of 3 and an integer (x).\\n\\nStep 2: Since x is an integer, the value of y will be determined by the sum of a multiple of 3 and 4.\\n\\nStep 3: We need to find a divisor that cannot divide y.

This means that the total number of Democratic participants (both male and female) is 1/3 * 750 = 250.\\n\\nSince we know the number of Democratic participants comes from both male and female, we can write another equation:\\n\\nF/2 + M/4 = 250\\n\\nMultiplying this equation by 4 to get rid of the fractions gives us:\\n\\n2F + M = 1000\\n\\n4.
