      "Incorrect: {'question': \"Samantha's investment portfolio consists of three stocks: an airline, a bank, and a computer company. In the month of February, the price of the airline's stock rose by 10%, that of the bank decreased by 10% and that of the computer company also decreased by 15%, but the overall value of her portfolio increased. If Samantha owns equal amounts of all three stocks, which of the following could be the initial prices of the three stocks in the order airline, bank, and computer company respectively?\", 'rationale': \"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information:\\n\\n1.

The price of the bank and computer company's stocks decreased by 10% and 15%, respectively.\\n\\nLet's assume the initial prices of the three stocks are x, y, and z, respectively.
