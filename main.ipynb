Now that we know the total bill with tip, which is still just the initial lunch cost, we add the tip to the original bill: $50 + $10 = $60\\n\\nSo, Tim's total expenditure (the amount he spent) is the original price of lunch plus the 20% tip.\\n\\nThe correct calculation for the final amount spent by Tim is:\\n\\nOriginal price of lunch: $50\\nTip: $10 (20% of $50)\\nTotal bill with tip: $60 (=$50 + $10)\\n\\nThus, we can see that option A) $60.00 is indeed the correct answer, as it represents the total amount spent, which includes both the original lunch cost and the 20% tip.\\n\\nAnd the answer is: A\", 'generated_answer': 'A', 'correct_answer': 'A'}\n",

       "  'rationale': \"Let's break down the problem step by step.\\n\\nFirst, we are given that Rs. 5600 is divided into three parts A, B, and C in the ratio 1/7 : 1/7 : 1/14. We can rewrite this ratio as a common denominator, which is 14. So, the ratio becomes:\\n\\nA : B : C = 2 : 2 : 1\\n\\nThis means that for every 2 parts of A, there are 2 parts of B and 1 part of C.\\n\\nThe total number of parts in the ratio is 2 + 2 + 1 = 5. So, the value of each part is:\\n\\nValue of each part = Rs. 5600 / 5 = Rs. 1120\\n\\nNow, we can find the values of A, B, and C by multiplying the value of each part by their respective ratios:\\n\\nA = (2/5) × Rs. 1120 = Rs. 448\\nB = (2/5) × Rs. 1120 = Rs. 448\\nC = (1/5) × Rs. 1120 = Rs. 224\\n\\nThe question asks how much A is more than C, so we need to find the difference between their values:\\n\\nDifference = A - C = Rs. 448 - Rs. 224 = Rs. 224\\n\\nHowever, this answer is not among the options provided. Let's re-evaluate our calculations.\\n\\nWe can simplify the ratio A : B : C = 2 : 2 : 1 to A : B : C = 4 : 4 : 2 by multiplying each part by 2. This means that for every 4 parts of A, there are 4 parts of B and 2 parts of C.\\n\\nThe total number of parts in the ratio is still 10 (4 + 4 + 2). So, the value of each part is:\\n\\nValue of each part = Rs. 5600 / 10 = Rs. 560\\n\\nNow, we can find the values of A, B, and C by multiplying the value of each part by their respective ratios:\\n\\nA = (4/10) × Rs. 560 = Rs. 224\\nB = (4/10) × Rs. 560 = Rs. 224\\nC = (2/10) × Rs. 560 = Rs. 112\\n\\nThe difference between A and C is still not among the options provided. However, if we find the difference in terms of a fraction with a denominator of 14 (since that's the common denominator in the original ratio), we get:\\n\\nDifference = A - C = Rs. 224 - Rs. 112 = Rs. 112/1 - Rs. 8 × 14 = Rs. 4\\n\\nNow, let's simplify this difference by multiplying both sides of the equation by 7 (since that's one of the factors in the original ratio):\\n\\nDifference × 7 = (Rs. 112/1) × 7 - (Rs. 8 × 14) × 7\\n= Rs. 784 - Rs. 992\\n Difference × 7 = -208\\n\\nWe now know that the difference between A and C is a negative value, which means we are looking for how much C is more than A.\\n\\nTherefore:\\n\\nDifference = C - A\\n= Rs. 992 - Rs. 784\\n= Rs. 208/(-1) × 7\\n= Rs. 208/(-7)\\n\\nSo, the correct difference in terms of an integer multiple of the original ratio's denominator (14) is actually equal to the negative value:\\n\\n Difference = -Rs. 8\\n\\nAnd the answer is: A\",\n",

If q is the square of a positive integer, n = √q, then (√n + 1)² = (n + 1)² ≠ n² + 2√q + 1, so this option does not necessarily equal the square of the next positive integer.\\n\\nOption B: n + 1. This is a simple increment of n by 1, but it doesn't form a perfect square unless n was originally a perfect square minus 1, which isn't guaranteed.\\n\\nOption C: n^2 + 1. Similarly, this increments n² by 1, forming an imperfect square, and like option B, it assumes knowledge about the nature of n that we don't have from the question.\\n\\nOption D: q + 2√q + 1. Let's examine what happens when you take (√n + 1)². This equals (n + 1)² = n² + 2n + 1.
