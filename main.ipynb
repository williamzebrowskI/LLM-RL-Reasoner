The marks obtained by Polly and Willy are in the ratio of...?', 'rationale': \"To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the marks obtained by Polly and Willy.\\n\\nLet's first consider the marks obtained by Polly and Sandy, which are in the ratio 3:5. This means that if Polly's marks are 3x, then Sandy's marks are 5x.\\n\\nNow, let's consider the marks obtained by Sandy and Willy, which are in the ratio 5:2. This means that if Sandy's marks are 5y, then Willy's marks are 2y.\\n\\nSince Sandy's marks appear in both ratios, we can equate them:\\n\\n3x = 5y\\n\\nNow, we need to express y in terms of x:\\n\\ny = (3/5)x\\n\\nWe also know that Sandy's marks are 5x. So, substituting the expression for y into the equation for Sandy's marks:\\n\\n5x = 5((3/5)x)\\n\\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\\n\\n5x = 3x\\n\\nThis means that x must be a multiple of 3.\\n\\nLet's choose the smallest possible value for x, which is 3. Then, Polly's marks are 3(3) = 9, and Sandy's marks are 5(3) = 15.\\n\\nNow, we need to find Willy's marks in terms of x. We know that Sandy's marks are 5x, so Willy's marks are 2y, where y is the value we found earlier:\\n\\ny = (3/5)x\\n\\nSubstituting x = 3 into this equation, we get:\\n\\ny = (3/5)(3) = 9/5\\n\\nNow, we can find Willy's marks by multiplying this value by 2:\\n\\nWilly's marks = 2(9/5) = 18/5\\n\\nSo, Polly's marks are 9 and Willy's marks are 18/5.\\n\\nThe ratio of the marks obtained by Polly and Willy is therefore 9:(18/5).\\n\\nTo simplify this ratio, we can multiply both terms by 5 to get rid of the fraction:\\n\\nPolly's marks = 9(5) = 45\\nWilly's marks = (18/5)(5) = 18\\n\\nNow we have a whole number ratio: 45:18. We can further simplify this ratio by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 9.\\n\\nSimplifying the ratio:\\n\\nPolly's marks = 45 ÷ 9 = 5\\nWilly's marks = 18 ÷ 9 = 2\\n\\nSo, the ratio of Polly's and Willy's marks is 5:2.\\n\\nAnswer: 5:2\", 'answer': '5:2'}\n",

Working together they will complete the work in how many days?', 'rationale': \"To solve this problem, we need to find the individual rates at which each person can complete the work.\\n\\nLet's denote the rate of work completion for A as R_A, B as R_B, and C as R_C. We'll express these rates as fractions of the total work completed per day.\\n\\nWe're given that:\\n1. A and B together can do the work in 8 days, so their combined rate is 1/8.\\n   => R_A + R_B = 1/8\\n\\n2. B and C together can do the work in 12 days, so their combined rate is 1/12.\\n   => R_B + R_C = 1/12\\n\\n3. A and C together can do the work in 16 days, so their combined rate is 1/16.\\n   => R_A + R_C = 1/16\\n\\nWe need to find a way to add up all three equations to get a single equation for R_A + R_B + R_C.\\n\\nTo do this, let's multiply each of the first two equations by 4 and the third by 3. This allows us to have the same denominator in all equations:\\n   => 4(R_A + R_B) = 4/8\\n   => 4(R_B + R_C) = 4/12\\n   => 3(R_A + R_C) = 3/16\\n\\nSimplifying these expressions gives us:\\n   => 4R_A + 4R_B = 1/2\\n   => 4R_B + 4R_C = 1/3\\n   => 3R_A + 3R_C = 1/16\\n\\nNow, we can add up all three equations (and their multipliers):\\n   => (4R_A + 4R_B) + (4R_B + 4R_C) + (3R_A + 3R_C) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/16\\n\\nCombining the terms on the left-hand side of this equation, we get:\\n   => 7R_A + 8R_B + 7R_C = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/16\\n\\nWe know from the first statement that R_A + R_B equals 1/8. We can plug this into our combined equation to simplify it:\\n   => 7(1/8) + 8R_B + 7R_C = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/16\\n\\nMultiplying out the left-hand side, we get:\\n   => 7/8 + 8R_B + 7R_C = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/16\\n\\nThe next step is to combine all the fractions on the right-hand side of the equation. We need a common denominator for 2, 3, and 16.\\n   => 1/2 = 8/16\\n   => 1/3 = 16/48\\n   => 1/16 remains the same\\n\\nWe can now rewrite our combined fraction with these changes:\\n   => 7/8 + 8R_B + 7R_C = (8+16)/48 + 1/16\\n   => 7/8 + 8R_B + 7R_C = 24/48 + 3/48\\n   => 7/8 + 8R_B + 7R_C = 27/48\\n\\nSubtracting the left-hand side from both sides (with the understanding that subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding a positive) gives us:\\n   => -1/8 + 8R_B + 7R_C = 9/48\\n\\nAt this point, we can convert -1/8 into an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 48.\\n   => -6/48 + 8R_B + 7R_C = 9/48\\n\\nWe then add 6/48 to both sides:\\n   => 8R_B + 7R_C = 15/48\\n\\nRecall the statement that we multiplied by 4 in our first manipulation: R_A + R_B equals 1/8. This is equivalent to saying R_A equals 1/8 - R_B.\\n   => R_A = -8R_B + 1/8\\n\\nSubstituting this expression for R_A into the initial combined equation (7R_A + 8R_B + 7R_C = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/16), we have:\\n   => 7(-8R_B + 1/8) + 8R_B + 7R_C = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/16\\n\\nDistributing the factor of -8 to R_B on the left-hand side, we get:\\n   => -56R_B + (7/8) + 8R_B + 7R_C = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/16\\n\\nThe terms with R_B cancel each other out, leaving us with:\\n   => (7/8) + 7R_C = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/16\\n\\nTo make the fractions on the right-hand side have a common denominator of 48, we convert them as follows:\\n   => (7/8) + 7R_C = 24/48 + 16/48 + 3/48\\n   => (7/8) + 7R_C = 43/48\\n\\nWe know from the initial manipulation that R_A + R_B equals 1/8, which is equivalent to saying R_A equals -8R_B + 1/8. We can now use this result in our calculation of 7R_C.\\n\\nUsing the fact that we added up all three original equations and then substituted for R_A using R_B, we find:\\n   => (4R_A + 4R_B) + (4R_B + 4R_C) + (3R_A + 3R_C) = (1/2 + 1/3 + 1/16)\\n   => -56R_B + (-8) + 7R_C + 8R_B + 8R_B + 7R_C = -16R_B + 15R_C\\n   => 7R_C = -16R_B + (9/48)\\n\\nMultiplying this equation by -48/7 to isolate the R_C term yields:\\n   => -16(6)R_B + (-48)(-8) = (48)(9)/(-7)\\n   => -96R_B + 384 = -432/7\\n\\nTo clear the denominators, we multiply both sides of this equation by -7.\\n   => 672R_B - 2688 = 3024\\n   => 672R_B = 5704\\n   => R_B = 8.5\\n\\nNow that we have found the value for R_B, we can plug it back into one of our earlier equations to find R_C.\\n\\nUsing the second equation: R_B + R_C = 1/12\\n   => 8.5 + R_C = 1/12\\n\\nMultiplying both sides by -12 (because multiplying a fraction by its negative is the same as adding a positive) gives us:\\n   => -102R_C = -103 + (-84)\\n   => -102R_C = -187\\n   => R_C = 187/102\\n\\nFinally, we can use our expressions for R_B and R_C to find R_A using any of our earlier equations. We'll choose the first one: R_A + R_B = 1/8.\\n\\nSubstituting in the value for R_B that we found gives us:\\n   => R_A + (8.5) = 1/8\\n\\nUsing a calculator, we can approximate this expression and solve for R_A:\\n   => R_A ≈ -66.5/102\\n   => R_A ≈ -0.65\\n\\nAt last, we have the individual values for R_A, R_B, and R_C.\\n\\nRecall that our final goal was to find 1/R_A + 1/R_B + 1/R_C.\\nPlugging in these values, we get:\\n   => (1/-0.65) + (1/8.5) + (1/187/102)\\n   => (-1.54) + 0.1176 + 0.0054\\n   => -1.427\\n\\nWe can approximate this to one decimal place and write our answer as follows:\\n   => The final answer is: 1.43\", 'answer': 'No Answer Extracted'}\n",

After producing a notebook of one color from that series, it produces a notebook of the next color. Once five are produced, the machine repeats the same pattern. If the machine began a day producing a red notebook and completed the day by producing a black notebook, how many notebooks could have been produced that day?', 'rationale': \"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\\n\\n1. The machine produces notebooks in a series of five colors: red, blue, black, white, and yellow.\\n2. It started the day producing a red notebook and completed the day producing a black notebook.\\n3. This means that the machine must have gone through at least one complete cycle (i.e., produced a notebook of each color) before starting another cycle on the same day.\\n4. In one complete cycle, it produces 5 notebooks.\\n5. Since the machine started the day with a red notebook and completed the day with a black notebook, it means that the first notebook of the new cycle is also red (since the colors repeat after every five).\\n6. Therefore, on this particular day, the machine must have produced at least one complete cycle plus one more red notebook.\\n7. This gives us a minimum of 5 notebooks (one complete cycle) + 1 more red notebook = 6 notebooks.\\n\\nHowever, we need to consider that the machine could also produce more than one complete cycle in the same day. Since each cycle consists of 5 notebooks, let's see how many notebooks can be produced if multiple cycles are completed:\\n\\n- The first complete cycle would consist of 5 notebooks (red, blue, black, white, and yellow).\\n- If another cycle is completed, it will add 5 more notebooks to the total.\\n- And so on.\\n\\nWe know that the machine started with a red notebook and ended with a black notebook. To find the number of notebooks produced, we can simply multiply the number of complete cycles by 5 (the number of notebooks in each cycle).\\n\\nSince the first cycle produces 5 notebooks, and the last cycle ends with a black notebook, it means that the machine must have completed at least one full cycle on this day. Therefore, the minimum number of notebooks produced would be:\\n\\nMinimum number of notebooks = Number of complete cycles × 5\\n= 1 × 5 (since we know there is at least one full cycle)\\n= 5\\n\\nHowever, since each complete cycle adds 5 notebooks to the total, let's consider that the machine could produce more than just one cycle in the same day. We're given no indication that it cannot.\\n\\nThe question does not specify any constraints on the number of cycles the machine can perform within a single day. Since we know it completed at least one full cycle (5 notebooks) and produced a black notebook as its last notebook, we should consider all possibilities:\\n\\n- If only one complete cycle is performed, then 5 notebooks are produced.\\n- If two complete cycles are performed, then 10 notebooks would be produced (2 × 5).\\n- If three complete cycles are performed... well, you get the idea.\\n\\nSince there's no restriction on the number of full cycles it can perform within a single day, let's analyze how many notebooks could have been produced if multiple cycles were completed:\\n\\nWe know that in each cycle, 5 notebooks are produced. So, for n complete cycles, we'll have n × 5 = 5n notebooks.\\n\\nHowever, since the question specifically asks us to consider all possibilities (with no specific number of cycles given), let's examine our findings so far:\\n\\n- The machine started with a red notebook and completed the day by producing a black notebook. This indicates that it must have performed at least one full cycle on this particular day.\\n- Each complete cycle produces 5 notebooks.\\n\\nConsidering these facts, we can safely say that if only one cycle was performed (the minimum required to end with a black notebook), then exactly 5 notebooks would be produced.\\n\\nIf more than one complete cycle were completed (without any stated limitations), the number of notebooks increases linearly with each additional full cycle. However, since no specific limit is mentioned for these cycles within the given timeframe, we cannot definitively determine how many total cycles could be completed in a day without assuming some form of constraint.\\n\\nTherefore, focusing on the information provided:\\n\\n- The minimum requirement to end with a black notebook is at least one complete cycle.\\n- There's no restriction on multiple full cycles within a single day mentioned in the problem statement.\\n\\nConsidering these points and the question itself, we should aim for the most straightforward interpretation that satisfies all given conditions. In this case, recognizing that a clear minimum (5 notebooks) exists due to the completion of at least one full cycle before ending with a black notebook.\\n\\nThus, acknowledging that while multiple cycles are possible without restrictions, our basic minimum to answer the question correctly is 5, based on completing the minimum required cycle.\\n\\nTherefore, we can confidently say that:\\n\\nAnswer: 5\", 'answer': '5'}\n",

      "Incorrect: {'question': 'In a mixture of 60 litres, the ratio of acid to base is 2 : 1. If this ratio is to be 1 : 2, then the quantity of base (in litres) to be further added is', 'rationale': \"To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\\n\\nStep 1: Understand the initial and final ratios.\\n\\nThe initial ratio of acid to base is 2:1. This means that for every 2 parts of acid, there is 1 part of base.\\n\\nLet's assume that initially, there are x litres of acid and y litres of base in the mixture. Then the initial ratio can be written as:\\n\\nx : y = 2 : 1\\n\\nStep 2: Express the initial quantities using the given total volume.\\n\\nWe know that the total volume of the mixture is 60 litres. This means that:\\n\\nx + y = 60\\n\\nUsing this equation, we can express x in terms of y or vice versa.\\n\\nStep 3: Determine the final ratio and quantity of acid.\\n\\nThe desired ratio of acid to base is 1 : 2, meaning there will be one part of acid for every two parts of base. Let's calculate the new quantities of acid (A) and base (B) after adding x litres of acid and y litres of base to achieve this ratio:\\n\\nA = 60 × (1/3)\\nB = 60 × (2/3)\\n\\nStep 4: Calculate how much base should be added.\\n\\nLet's denote the quantity of base to be further added as 'z' litres. After adding z litres of base, the new total volume will be 60 + z litres.\\n\\nThe amount of acid in this final mixture is still x litres (as no acid was added), but we want the ratio of acid to base to change from 2:1 to 1:2. This means that the quantity of acid should be one-third of the new total volume, and the quantity of base should be two-thirds of the new total volume.\\n\\nWe already have x litres of acid in the final mixture, which is equal to A = (60 × 3)/3 = 20 litres, so there are 20 litres of acid. We need to find out how much base we should add so that the ratio becomes 1:2 and the quantity of base will be B = (60 + z) × (2/3).\\n\\nSince we want the final ratio of acid to base to be 1 : 2, let's calculate the desired quantities of acid and base:\\n\\nA = (60 + z)/3\\nB = (60 + z)\\n\\nStep 5: Express 'z' in terms of known variables.\\n\\nNow that we know A and B, we can express these values using x and y from Step 1. The quantity of base is given by the formula:\\ny=20\\n\\nWe want to find how much base (denoted as 'z') should be further added so that this ratio changes to 1:2.\\n\\nThe desired amount of acid remains unchanged at A = 20 litres, but we need to find out how much base should be added. Let's subtract the initial quantity of base (y) from the new total volume (60 + z), where z is the additional base needed:\\n\\n(60 + z)/3 - y = 1/2\\n\\nStep 6: Solve for 'z'.\\n\\nWe want to add an amount of base 'z' that satisfies this condition. Let's first calculate what the correct quantities should be after adding base.\\n\\nSince A = (60 + z)/3 and B = (60 + z), then we must have:\\nB - y = 1/2 * (A)\\n\\nWe need to express everything in terms of known values. We already found out that x = 20 and y = 20.\\n\\nSubstituting these known quantities, we get:\\n\\n(60 + z)/3 - 20 = 1/2 * 20\\n\\nMultiplying through by 6 to clear the denominators gives us:\\n2 (60 + z) - 120 = 120\\nWe solve for 'z' and plug in the correct values.\\n\\nAnswer:\", 'answer': 'No Answer Extracted'}\n",

       "  'rationale': \"To find the average age of Janice and Lisa 7 years ago, we first need to determine their ages 7 years ago.\\n\\nJanice's current age is 23 + z. To find her age 7 years ago, we subtract 7 from this expression: (23 + z) - 7 = 16 + z.\\n\\nSimilarly, Lisa's current age will be 21 + p in p years. To find her age 7 years ago, we subtract 7 from this expression: (21 + p) - 7 = 14 + p.\\n\\nThe average of their ages 7 years ago is the sum of their ages divided by 2. So, we add their ages and divide by 2:\\n\\n((16 + z) + (14 + p)) / 2\\n\\nCombine like terms:\\n\\n(30 + z + p) / 2\\n\\nNow, to find this average age, we need more information about the values of z and p.\\n\\nHowever, let's assume that z = p. This would mean that Janice was as many years old as Lisa will be in x years ago (where x is some number). Since Janice was 23 years old z years ago and Lisa will be 21 years old in p years, if we let z = p = q, then both expressions equal each other:\\n\\n23 + q = 21 + q\\n\\nSubtracting q from both sides leaves us with:\\n\\n23 = 21\\n\\nThis is obviously not true. However, since the two equations can't be made to equal each other without using some number that will make them equal (q), and we know z=p=q doesn't work, the only way these statements could possibly hold true for any real values of z and p would be if there are an infinite number of possible solutions. This can happen when z = p is not equal to zero, because then:\\n\\nz = p ≠ 0\\n\\nWe can multiply both sides by the same number (a positive number greater than one), and it will still be true. The same thing happens with z + p in the expression we found above.\\n\\nSince there are an infinite number of possible solutions for z and p where z+p is not equal to zero, the average age they were 7 years ago can be any real number, as long as that number is a valid result of the equation ((30 + z + p) / 2).\\n\\nBut if we take this average to be some real number 'a', then for any x in R (the set of all real numbers), a can equal x. We just need to find values of z and p such that (z+p)/2 equals the desired average age 'x'.\\n\\nThe only way this can happen is if:\\n\\nz + p = 2 * x\\n\\nGiven our knowledge about Janice's and Lisa's ages, we must also consider the fact that the average age they were 7 years ago cannot be greater than their average current age. Therefore,\\n\\n(16+z)/2 > (21+p)/2 / 2.\\n\\nMultiplying both sides of this inequality by 4:\\n\\n32 + 4z > 28 + 4p\\n\\nSubtracting z from both sides, and adding p to both sides leaves us with:\\n\\n4z - z + p > 28 - 4z + 4p\\n3z + p > 28\\n\\nNow we have two inequalities:\\n\\nz+p = 2x (1)\\n3z + p > 28\\n\\n(1) can be rewritten as:\\n\\np = 2x-z\\n\\nSubstituting this expression for p in the second inequality, we get:\\n\\n3z+2x-z>28\\n2x+2z>28\\n\\nDivide both sides by 2:\\n\\nx+z>14\\n\\nNow we have two inequalities and the original equation that said z=p. However, since z = p is not equal to zero, if we choose a value of x that makes x + z > 14 true, then this will also make x+z=14 false.\\n\\nSince Janice was 23 years old z years ago, she must be older than Lisa now (because z cannot equal -23).\\n\\nIf we assume she is exactly one year older than Lisa, the only way this could happen would be if Lisa's age in p years equals Janice's current age minus one. Therefore,\\n\\n21+p = 23\\np = 2\\n\\nz and p must have the same value for our problem to make sense:\\n\\nz = p\\n\\nSince z=p=2, x+z > 14 becomes x + 2 > 14 or x > 12.\\n\\nThe question states that Lisa will be 21 years old in p years. This means that Lisa is currently 21 - p years old. Since we already found that p = 2, then the current age of Lisa is:\\n\\n21 - 2 = 19\\n\\nThus Lisa's and Janice's ages 7 years ago must have been 16 and 12 respectively.\\n\\nTo find their average age 7 years ago, you add 16+12 and divide by 2 to get:\\n\\n(16 + 12) / 2\\n= 28/2\\n= 14\\n\\nTherefore the answer is 14.\\n\\nAnswer: 14\",\n",
