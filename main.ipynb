If Friend P\\'s rate is 15% faster than Friend Q\\'s, how many kilometers will Friend P have walked when they pass each other?\\n\\nLet\\'s break it down:\\n\\n* Let Friend Q\\'s speed be x km/h.\\n* Then, Friend P\\'s speed is 1.15x km/h (since it\\'s 15% faster).\\n* The time taken to cover the entire trail for both friends would be the same.\\n\\nLet t be the time in hours.\\n\\nFor Friend Q: distance = rate × time ⇒ 43 = x × t\\n\\nFor Friend P: distance = rate × time ⇒ 43 = 1.15x × t\\n\\nSince t is the same for both, we can divide the second equation by the first:\\n\\n(43) / (43) = (1.15x) / (x)\\n\\nThis simplifies to:\\n\\n1 = 1.15 (canceling out the x\\'s)\\n\\nThis means that Friend P walks at a rate of 1.15 times the rate of Friend Q.\\n\\nTo find how much distance Friend P covers when they meet, let\\'s consider the ratio of their speeds:\\n\\nFriend P : Friend Q = 1.15x : x = 1.15 : 1\\n\\nSince the total trail is 43 km, and the ratio of speeds is 1.15:1, the distance covered by Friend P will be 115/16 (or approximately 7.19) times the distance covered by Friend Q when they meet.\\n\\nGiven that the total trail is 43 km, we can find the actual distance covered by Friend P:\\n\\nDistance = (115/16) × Distance covered by Friend Q\\n\\nTo get a whole number, let\\'s consider a multiple of the denominator (16). If we multiply both sides by 16, we get:\\n\\nDistance = (115/1) × Distance covered by Friend Q × (1/16)\\n\\nThis simplifies to:\\n\\nDistance = 115 × 43 / 16\\n= (115 × 43) / 16\\n≈ 230.44\\n\\nNow, let\\'s find the actual distance covered by Friend P when they meet. We know that this is a multiple of 4 since the total trail length is a multiple of 4.

So, let\\'s consider the case where Y is an even digit.\\n\\nIn this case, X can take any value. However, since it\\'s a 3-digit number, we know that:\\n\\n8XY = 800 + 10X + Y\\n\\nSince Y is even, let\\'s try making it the smallest possible even digit (Y = 2).\\n\\nIf X was an odd digit (like 1 or 3), then XY would be an odd digit, which can\\'t happen since the number has to end with an even digit.\\n\\nThe next smallest digit for Y is an even digit, but we want X to be as small as possible. Let\\'s consider Y = 4 and see what value of X gives us a product that matches one of the answer choices.\\n\\n\\nIf Y = 4, then XY would equal 24. The product of X and Y would also be 24 (assuming both are single-digit numbers).\\n\\nComparing this to the answer choices, we find:\\n\\n\\nOption C: n^2 + 1 ≠ XY; however, Option C itself has a variable \"n\" which is not present in our calculations.\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s now try to find another pair of digits that satisfy the conditions.\\n\\nIf X = 3 and Y = 6 (even), then XY would be 36.
