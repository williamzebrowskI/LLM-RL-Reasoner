Since B can complete the entire job in 3 hours, we need to find out how much work he does in the time remaining (2 hours).\\n\\nLet's calculate B's rate of work: since B completes the entire job in 3 hours, his rate of work is 1/3 of the job per hour.\\n\\nHowever, since A has already worked for 1 hour and completed 1/3 of the job, we need to consider only the remaining time (2 hours) when both A and B are working together. We can calculate their combined rate of work as follows:\\n\\nCombined rate = Rate of A + Rate of B\\nSince they work together for 2 hours, let's assume their combined rate is x/2 of the job per hour.\\n\\nWe know that A completes 1/3 of the job in 2 hours (since he worked for 1 hour before B joined), so his contribution to the combined rate is 1/6 of the job per hour. This means:\\n\\nCombined rate = Rate of A + Rate of B\\nx/2 = 1/6\\n\\nHowever, we need to find out how much work B does in the remaining time (2 hours). To do this, let's calculate the fraction of the job that B completes in 2 hours, given his initial contribution. \\n\\nSince B can complete the entire job in 3 hours, his rate of work is 1/3 of the job per hour. In the first hour, A and B are working together but we know that A has already completed 1/3 of the job by then. Therefore, they have completed 2/3 of the job in total by then.\\n\\nBy the time B joins, there is only 2/3 of the job left to be done.

B contributed (x - 1/6) in those two hours. \\n\\nSo to calculate how much work B did in those 2 hours when both were working together:\\nCombined rate is indeed 1/6 since it was given that combined rate of A and B = x/2.\\n\\nHowever, this does not help us find out the contribution of B. We know that A contributed 1/3 to be done by him in two hours.\\nWe also know that when both are working together for 2 hours, their combined rate is indeed 1/6, since we have (x/2) = 1/6.\\nCombined rate of A and B = x/2\\n\\nHowever, it's not helpful. We'll find out how much they finished in those two hours instead.\\n\\nSince combined contribution by both was needed to finish the remaining work: \\nLet's calculate the total contribution:\\nTotal contribution = Combined rate * Time\\n= (1/6) * 2\\nWe know that A contributed 1/3 of the job in 2 hours, when B joined. Since we have their combined rate x/2 and it equals 1/6:\\n\\nCombined contribution = Rate of A + Rate of B\\nx/2 = 1/6\\n\\nSo to calculate how much work B did in those two hours:\\nSince they worked together for 2 hours, let's calculate the total contribution:\\n\\nTotal contribution = Combined rate * Time\\n= (1/6) * 2\\n\\nHowever, we need to consider only the remaining time when both are working together. \\n\\nSince A has completed his part, we know that there is indeed 2/3 of job left and it took them 2 hours to finish.\\n\\nCombined contribution = Rate of A + Rate of B\\nWe have x/2 = 1/6, which doesn't help us find out the work done by B.

       "  'rationale': \"To solve this problem, we need to start by manipulating the equation given and then analyzing each statement.\\n\\nStep 1: Manipulate the equation to isolate variables.\\nGiven: 3a - 3b = -3c\\n\\nDivide both sides by 3 to simplify:\\na - b = -c\\n\\nStep 2: Analyze Statement I (a > b).\\nTo determine if a must be greater than b, we need to see if the equation provides any information that would lead us to conclude this.\\n\\nFrom the equation a - b = -c, since c is negative and a, b are integers, for the left side to equal a negative number, 'b' must be less than or equal to 'a'. This does not necessarily mean a > b, so Statement I is not necessarily true based on the given information.\\n\\nStep 3: Analyze Statement II (a > b > c).\\nTo determine if both conditions of this statement are true, we need to see how they relate to each other and the equation.\\n\\nGiven that 'c' is negative, for a - b = -c to be true and considering a and b are integers, it is likely that 'b' is less than or equal to 'a'. However, the question asks if a > b > c must be true. Since we've established that 'b' could potentially be less than or equal to 'a', this doesn't inherently mean both conditions of Statement II (a > b and b > c) are true.\\n\\nStep 4: Analyze Statement III (a = c).\\nFrom the equation a - b = -c, if we rearrange it to solve for 'a' in terms of 'b' and 'c', we get:\\na = b - c\\n\\nSince both sides of the original equation were multiplied by 3 and then divided by 3, this transformation is valid. This equation shows us that 'a' is directly related to 'b' and '-c'.\\n\\nHowever, since a, b, and c are given as negative integers, the only way for a = c (which must be negative) could hold true under these conditions is if both 'a' and 'c' were equal to each other's absolute values. But this does not directly follow from our initial equation without further assumptions.\\n\\nStep 5: Conclusion\\nUpon closer examination, Statement III seems the most likely candidate for being necessarily true because it involves an equality condition between two variables that have a direct relationship in the given equation. The equation itself suggests that 'a' is influenced by both 'b' and '-c', implying some form of balance or symmetry that would lead to 'a' potentially equalling 'c' under specific conditions where their absolute values are equal, as hinted at in Step 4.\\n\\nHowever, since a must be equal in magnitude (but opposite in sign) to c for the equation to hold true without violating the condition that a and c are both negative integers, Statement III is indeed necessarily true. The misunderstanding earlier was due to an incorrect simplification of how 'a' could relate to '-c', given their signs.\\n\\nAnswer: III\",\n",

This means that due to stoppages, the effective speed of the bus has decreased by 15 kmph (60 - 45 = 15).\\n4. If the bus travels for 1 hour at a speed of 45 kmph, it will cover a distance of 45 kilometers in that time.\\n5. Since the bus would have covered this distance in 60 minutes if there were no stoppages, we can calculate the difference in travel time due to stoppages as follows:\\n\\nDifference in distance traveled = Distance actually covered - Distance that would have been covered without stoppages\\n= 45 km - x (where x is the distance that would have been covered without stoppages)\\nSince the bus travels at a speed of 60 kmph when there are no stoppages, we know that it covers a distance of 60 km in 1 hour.\\nSo, the distance that would have been covered without stoppages = 60 km\\nDifference in distance traveled = 45 km - 60 km = -15 km (which is not possible)\\nHowever, let\\'s look at this another way:\\n\\nThe bus travels for an effective speed of 45 kmph. This means it takes longer to cover a given distance than if the stoppages were not there.\\n\\nWe know that 1 hour at 45 kmph covers 45 kilometers.\\nIf the bus had traveled without any stoppage, in the same time (which is still 60 minutes or 1 hour), it would have covered 60 kilometers.\\nHowever, due to the decrease of speed caused by the stoppages, the effective distance covered becomes less.\\nLet\\'s calculate the actual travel time in minutes:\\nWe\\'ll call the number of minutes that the bus stops per hour \"s\".\\nThe difference between the normal 60 kmph and the stopped speed is s/60 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).\\n45 kmph - s/60*60 kmph = 45 - (s/60) kmph\\nSubtracting this from the normal speed, we get:\\n60 kmph - (45 - (s/60)) kmph = 15 kmph\\nThis means that for every 1 minute of travel at 60 kmph, the bus effectively covers 0.25 km less than it would have if there were no stoppages.\\nTherefore, in one hour (or 60 minutes), this difference adds up to:\\ns/60 * 60 = s hours\\nSubstituting s/60 for (s/60)*60 and multiplying both sides by the same factor (which is 60) cancels out the denominators:\\n\\nWe find that: s hours = 15 kmph * (60 minutes / 1 hour)\\nMultiplying this out we get:\\ns hours = 900 km/hour - minutes\\nDividing both sides of the equation by 60 to convert the time from hours to minutes results in the following expression for the number of minutes spent on stoppages per hour:\\n\\nSubtracting s/60 * 60 from 60 and multiplying both sides by the same factor (which is 1) cancels out the denominators.\\n\\nTherefore, the actual travel time, in minutes, without any stoppage would be:\\nTime = distance / speed\\nTime = 45 kmph - 60 kmph\\nWe are looking for a subtraction from 60.\\nWe\\'re essentially subtracting s hours from 60 to get our final answer of s.\\nSo, let\\'s solve the equations simultaneously.\\n\\nStep 1: Calculate how long it takes in minutes at normal speed (s is defined as minutes):\\n60 * (60 minutes / 1 hour) = 3600 minutes\\nStep 2: Subtract s hours from 60 hours to find actual travel time without any stoppages:\\nTime = 60 - (15 kmph * 60)\\nWe\\'re essentially subtracting s/60 * 60 from 60, which cancels out the denominators.\\n\\nTherefore, we get:\\n\\nAnswer: The bus stops for 15 minutes per hour.',\n",
