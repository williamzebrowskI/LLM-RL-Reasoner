            "output": "To find the remainder when p is divided by 10, we first need to understand the pattern of remainders for powers of 4.\n\nThe remainder of a number can be found by looking at its last digit. When we raise a number to different powers, the last digit follows a specific pattern. For example, when you square a number (i.e., raise it to the power of 2), the possible remainders are always among the set {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9}.\n\nNow, since 4 raised to any positive integer will end in one of the digits from this set, let's find which digit appears when raising 4 to consecutive powers. We get:\n\n- 4^1 = 4\n- 4^2 = 16 (ends with 6)\n- 4^3 = 64 (ends with 4)\n- 4^4 = 256 (ends with 6)\n- 4^5 = 1024 (ends with 4)\n\nWe can see that the remainders alternate between 4 and 6.\n\nGiven q is a positive integer and multiple of 2, it means we are always raising 4 to an even power. This implies the remainder will be either 4 or 6 when divided by 10.\n\nHowever, since p = 4^q, if q is a multiple of 2 (an even number), p will end in 6, not 4. Therefore, when we divide p by 10, we are left with a remainder of 6."

After one year at 5%, the amount becomes:\n\nA1 = P(1 + 0.05)^1\n= P(1.05)\n\nAfter two years, we add the interest for the second year (10%) to A1:\n\nA2 = A1(1 + 0.10)^1\n= P(1.05)(1.10)\n= P(1.05)(1.10)\n= P(1.155)\n\nFinally, after three years, we add the interest for the third year (20%) to A2:\n\nA3 = A2(1 + 0.20)^1\n= P(1.155)(1.20)\n= P(1.155)(1.20)\n= P(1.386)\n\nWe are given that A3 = Rs. 1386, so we can solve for P:\n\nP(1.386) = 1386\n\nDividing both sides by 1.386 gives us the initial sum:\n\nP = 1386 / 1.386\n= 1000\n\nTherefore, the initial sum was Rs. 1000."

Food X contains 10% protein, so for every 100 grams of food X, there are 10 grams of protein.\n3. Similarly, food Y contains 15% protein, so for every 100 grams of food Y, there are 15 grams of protein.\n4. The rabbit's diet provides exactly 39 grams of protein daily, and this is made up of a mixture of food X and food Y.\n5. Let x be the number of grams of food X in the mixture, and let y be the number of grams of food Y in the mixture. We know that x + y = 300 (since there are 300 grams of the mixture in total).\n6. Since food X contains 10% protein, the amount of protein from food X is 0.1x.\n7. Similarly, since food Y contains 15% protein, the amount of protein from food Y is 0.15y.\n8. We know that the total amount of protein in the diet is 39 grams, so we can set up the equation: 0.1x + 0.15y = 39.\n9. Since x + y = 300, we can express y as 300 - x and substitute this into the second equation: 0.1x + 0.15(300 - x) = 39.\n10.

Since a certain number of men can do a work in 20 days, we can say that the total amount of work done by the men is proportional to the product of the number of men and the number of days they worked.

The difference in speed is 45 - 36 = 9 kmph.\n\nStep 2: Convert the difference in speed from kmph to minutes per hour.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the speed difference into minutes by dividing by the train's normal hourly distance it could have traveled if it didn't stop. Let's assume x as the total time for which the train runs without stopping (speed excluding stoppages). The speed of the train excluding stoppages is 45 kmph and including stoppages is 36 kmph.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the actual time spent by the train on running in an hour.\nThe actual time spent by the train while running, i.e., not stopping is (45/100) * 60 = 27 minutes. The difference between the maximum speed and minimum speed of the train can be calculated as: (45 - 36) * (1/45) * 60.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the actual time spent by the train on stopping in an hour.\nNow, let's calculate how long it takes for the train to cover the distance that would have been covered at its full speed if there were no stoppages. This will be calculated as: (9/45) * 60 = (1/5) * 60 = 12 minutes.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the actual time spent by the train on stopping in an hour.\nNow, we know that the total number of minutes for which the train runs without stopping is 27 minutes and it stops for x - 27 minutes. Hence, to find out how many minutes does the train stop per hour, we need to subtract the total running time from the total time.\n\nStep 6: Finally calculate the actual time spent by the train on stopping in an hour.\nTotal running time = Total time per hour - Stopping time per hour\n= 60 - 12\n= 48 minutes\n\nStep 7: So, we can conclude that the train stops for 12 minutes every hour."

We can do this by comparing the distances they cover in a given time period (let's say 1 second).\n\nSince the speed of the hare is x m/s, it covers x meters in 1 second. Since one leap of the hare is equal to 5x/8 meters, the dog will cover the same distance as the hare (i.e., x meters) by taking 5 leaps.\n\nThe ratio of their speeds is thus the number of leaps taken by the dog divided by the number of leaps taken by the hare, multiplied by the speed of the dog divided by the speed of the hare:\n\n(5 / 8) × (5x / x) = 25/8\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the speed of the dog to that of the hare is 25:8."

We know that time = distance/speed.\n\nFor the first train:\nTime taken to cross a telegraph post = 10 seconds\nDistance covered (length of the train) = 120 meters\n\nSpeed of the first train, v1 = Distance / Time = 120/10 = 12 m/s\n\nSimilarly, for the second train:\nTime taken to cross a telegraph post = 16 seconds\nDistance covered (length of the train) = 120 meters\n\nSpeed of the second train, v2 = Distance / Time = 120/16 = 7.5 m/s\n\nNow that we have the speeds of both trains, let's calculate their relative speed when moving in opposite directions.\n\nRelative speed, v = v1 + v2 = 12 + 7.5 = 19.5 m/s\n\nSince they are traveling in opposite direction, their speeds add up to give the relative speed.\n\nThe total distance that needs to be covered for them to cross each other is the sum of their lengths:\nTotal distance = Length of first train + Length of second train = 120 + 120 = 240 meters\n\nNow, we can find the time taken for them to cross each other using the formula Time = Distance / Relative speed.\n\nTime taken to cross each other = Total distance / Relative speed = 240 / 19.5 ≈ 12.31 seconds"

The second tap can empty the cistern in 12 hours, which means it empties 1/12 of the cistern in one hour.\n3. When both taps are opened simultaneously, their rates of filling and emptying the cistern add up. So, the net rate at which the cistern is being filled is (1/6 - 1/12) per hour.\n4. To find the common denominator, we can convert 1/6 to 2/12 and 1/12 remains as it is. So, the net rate becomes (2/12 - 1/12) = 1/12 per hour.\n5. This means that together, the taps fill 1/12 of the cistern in one hour.\n6. Since the first tap alone can fill the entire cistern in 6 hours, and now it's being helped by the second tap which adds to its rate, we need to find how much time it will take for both taps working together to fill the cistern.\n\nThe formula to calculate the combined rate is: (Rate of filling + Rate of emptying) = Combined rate.\n\nHere, the combined rate is 1/6 (rate of filling by tap 1) - 1/12 (rate of emptying by tap 2) per hour.\n\nSince we already calculated that their combined rate is 1/12 per hour, we need to find how long it takes for the combined rate of 1/12 to fill the cistern. Since it's a simple inverse relationship, if the first tap can fill the cistern in 6 hours (which means its filling rate is 1/6), and when both taps work together their net rate is 1/12 per hour, we simply multiply the time taken by the individual rate of the slower tap to get the time taken by the combined rates.\n\nHence, it will take 6 * 2 = 12 hours for the cistern to be filled completely with both taps working together."

The letters are L, O, G, A, R, I, T, H, M, and S. There are 10 unique letters.\n\nSince we want to form a 4-letter word without repetition, we can choose any 4 letters out of the 10 unique letters. This is a combination problem, and we can calculate it as follows:\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!)\n= 10! / (4!6!)\n= (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6!) / (4!6!)\n= (10 × 9 × 8 × 7) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n= 5040 / 24\n= 210\n\nSo, there are 210 ways to choose the 4 letters for our word.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of arrangements of these 4 letters. Since repetition is not allowed and the order matters (because it's a word), this is a permutation problem. We can calculate it as follows:\n\nP(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!)\n= 10! / (4!6!)\n(same calculation as above)\n\nHowever, we are choosing 4 letters out of the 10 unique letters, and then arranging them in different ways.

            "output": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The winner has a margin of 20% of the votes polled, which means that if x is the total number of votes polled, then the difference between the votes for the winner and the loser is 0.2x.\n2. If 3000 people change their mind and vote for the loser, the loser would have won by a margin of 20% of the votes polled, which means that the difference between the votes for the loser and the winner would be -0.2(x-3000).\n3. Since the absolute value of the difference is the same in both cases (because it's a margin), we can set up an equation: |0.2x| = |-0.2(x-3000)|.\n4. Simplifying the equation, we get 0.2|x| = -0.2(x-3000).\n5. Dividing both sides by -0.2 (and remembering that x is a positive number because it's a count of votes), we get |x| = x - 15000.\n6. Now, since the absolute value of x is just x itself in this case (because x is already a positive number), we can simplify further: x = x - 15000.\n7. Subtracting x from both sides gives us 0 = -15000.\n8. This equation doesn't make sense because it implies that something can be equal to zero and also be a negative value at the same time, which is a logical contradiction.\n\nHowever, we know that votes are always positive numbers. Therefore, let's look at our steps again. In step 4, we said |0.2x| = |-0.2(x-3000)|. This equation should have x as its solution because it represents the total number of votes polled in both cases.\n\nConsidering this, let's correct our approach:\n\nWe can simplify the equation |0.2x| = |-0.2(x-3000)| to get 0.2|x| = 0.2(x - 15000).\n\nNow, we divide both sides by 0.2 (which is positive), so it doesn't affect the direction of the inequality:\n\n|x| = x - 15000\n\nThis equation still has a logical contradiction because x cannot be equal to itself minus 15000 and also not be zero.\n\nHowever, looking at this from a different perspective: we know that if there are x votes for the winner, then (x - 0.2x) votes are actually votes for the loser in the first case. If 3000 people switch sides, then (x-3000 - 0.2(x - 3000)) = (x - 15000) would be votes for the winner.\n\nGiven this information, let's recalculate the number of votes polled using a new perspective:\n\nLet x be the total number of votes polled in the election initially.\n\nInitially, votes for the winner: x\nvotes for the loser: x - 0.2x = 0.8x\n\nNow, if 3000 people switch sides and vote for the loser, then:\nvotes for the loser are now (0.8x + 3000)\n\nGiven that this would result in a 20% margin of votes polled for the winner:\n\n(x - (0.8x + 3000)) = 0.2(x) \n\nThis equation simplifies to: \n(-0.2x + 3000) = 0.2(x)\n-0.4x + 6000 = 0\n-0.4x = -6000\n\nDividing by -0.4:\n\nx = 15000\n\nSo the total number of votes polled in the election initially is indeed 15000."

            "output": "To find the cost of the tax-free items, let's first calculate the total value of the taxable purchases.\n\nLet's denote the cost of the taxable purchases as x. Since the sales tax on these purchases is 30 paise (which is equal to Rs. 0.30), we can use the tax rate formula:\n\nTax = Tax Rate × Cost of Taxable Purchases\n\nGiven that the tax rate is 5% and the tax amount is Rs. 0.30, we can set up the equation as follows:\n\n0.30 = (5/100) × x\n\nTo find x, multiply both sides by 100 and divide by 5:\n\nx = 0.30 × 100 / 5\nx = 6\n\nSo, the cost of the taxable purchases is Rs. 6.\n\nNow, let's find the total value of all items purchased (which includes both tax-free and taxable items). We know that Daniel spent a total of Rs. 25 on everything. Out of this amount, the cost of the tax-free items can be found by subtracting the sum of the tax and the cost of the taxable purchases from the total.\n\nCost of Tax-Free Items = Total Cost - (Tax + Cost of Taxable Purchases)\n= 25 - (0.30 + 6)\n\nFirst, convert Rs. 0.30 to whole numbers:\n0.30 = 30 paise = Rs. 0.30\n\nThen subtract the tax amount and the cost of taxable purchases from the total cost:\n\nCost of Tax-Free Items = 25 - 36.3 (after converting 0.30 to Rs.)\n= -11.3\n\nThis calculation is incorrect because we cannot have a negative value for the cost of items.\n\nRecalculate the cost of tax-free items by adding the tax and cost of taxable purchases in rupees:\n\nTax = 30 paise = Rs. 0.30\nCost of Taxable Purchases = Rs. 6\n\nSo, when adding these values together, we should get:\nTotal Cost of Tax-Free Items = Total Amount - (Tax + Cost of Taxable Purchases)\n= 25 - (0.30 + 6)\n\nFirst, add the tax amount and cost of taxable purchases:\n0.30 + 6 = 6.30\n\nThen subtract this sum from the total cost:\n\nCost of Tax-Free Items = 25 - 6.3\n= 18.7\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with a currency that only accepts whole numbers (paise) for small amounts, it's more accurate to represent these values in terms of paise.\n\nLet's convert this value back into rupees:\nCost of Tax-Free Items = 25 - 6.3\n= 18.7\n\nConverting the tax amount and cost of taxable purchases from rupees to paise for easier calculation:\nTax = Rs. 0.30 = 30 paise\nCost of Taxable Purchases = Rs. 6 = 600 paise\n\nNow calculate the total value in paise:\nTotal Value in Paise = Total Cost × 100 (since we're dealing with rupees and want to convert everything into paise for easier calculation)\n= 25 × 100\n= 2500 paise\n\nNext, subtract the sum of tax amount and cost of taxable purchases from this total:\n\nCost of Tax-Free Items in Paise = Total Value - (Tax + Cost of Taxable Purchases)\n= 2500 - (30 + 600)\n\nSimplify inside the parentheses:\nTotal Value in Paise - (Tax + Cost of Taxable Purchases) \n= 2500 - 630\n= 1870\n\nTo convert this back into rupees, divide by 100:\nCost of Tax-Free Items = 1870 / 100\n= Rs. 18.70\n\nSo, the cost of tax-free items is approximately Rs. 18.70."

            "output": "Let's denote the number of sprockets that machine B produces per hour as x. Since it takes machine A 10 hours longer to produce 330 sprockets, we can set up an equation based on their production rates.\n\nMachine B produces x sprockets per hour, so in 330/x hours, it will produce 330 sprockets.\nSimilarly, Machine A produces (0.9x) sprockets per hour (10% less than machine B), and in the time that takes machine B to produce 330 sprockets (i.e., 330/x hours) it will have produced a total of 330/x * (0.9x).\n\nSince both machines produce 330 sprockets, we can equate their production:\n(330 / x) = ((330 / x) * 0.9)\n\nMultiplying both sides by x to get rid of the denominator gives us:\n330 = 297\n\nThis equation doesn't make sense because it's saying that 330 is equal to 297. This means our assumption about the time taken by machine A was incorrect, and we need to consider a different approach.\n\nLet's denote the time taken by machine B as y hours. Then machine A takes y + 10 hours.\nWe know that machine B produces 10% more sprockets per hour than machine A. This means machine B produces x = 1.1 * (330/y) sprockets per hour.\n\nMachine A, which produces less sprockets per hour, will take longer to produce the same number of sprockets (330), and its production rate is therefore:\n(330 / (y + 10))\n\nSince we know that machine B takes y hours, it's also true that it can make 330 sprockets in y hours. So its production rate per hour is indeed x = 330/y.\n\nEquating the two expressions for machine A's and B's production rates gives us:\n(330 / (y + 10)) = (330/y) * 0.9\n\nMultiplying both sides by (y + 10)y to eliminate the denominators, we get:\n\n330y = 297(y + 10)\n\nExpanding the equation on the right-hand side and combining like terms gives us:\n330y = 297y + 2970\n\nSubtracting 297y from both sides results in:\n33y = 2970\n\nDividing both sides by 33, we get:\n\ny = 90\n\nSo machine B takes 90 hours to make 330 sprockets.\n\nNow that we have the time taken by machine B (y), we can find its production rate per hour. This is simply:\nx = 330 / y = 330 / 90 = 3.67\n\nSince machine A produces 10% less than machine B, its production rate per hour is:\n0.9 * x = 0.9 * 3.67 = 3.3\n\nThe answer to the question of how many sprockets per hour does machine A produce?"

            "input": "A number when divided by 221 gives a remainder 43, what remainder will be obtained by dividing the same number 17?",
            "output": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how remainders work when numbers are divided.\n\n1. First, let's consider the initial situation: a number (let's call it 'x') divided by 221 gives a remainder of 43. This can be represented as:\n\n   x = 221q + 43\n\n   where q is the quotient and 'x' is the dividend.\n\n2. Now, we need to find what happens when this same number 'x' is divided by 17. To do that, let's look at our equation from step 1.\n\n3. Since we are trying to understand how a number behaves in division by different divisors (in this case, going from divisor 221 to divisor 17), we need to see what happens when you divide the entire expression (x = 221q + 43) by 17.\n\n4. Dividing the entire equation by 17:\n\n   x / 17 = (221q + 43) / 17\n\n5. When dividing the sum of two numbers, we can separate them and then divide each term individually if they share a common divisor.\n\n6. The number 221 is divisible by 17 because 221 = 13 * 17. Hence:\n\n   (221q) / 17 = q (since 221q becomes 17q when divided by 17)\n\n7. Now, let's look at the second term in our division (43 / 17). This will give us the remainder we're looking for.\n\n8. Since 43 is not divisible by 17, it will be a non-zero, whole number quotient with some remainder. To find this remainder, you divide 43 by 17:\n\n   43 / 17 = 2.529 (approximately)\n\n9. Multiplying this result by 17 gives the part of 'x' that's exactly divisible by 17. This leaves us with a remainder from the division of 43 by 17.\n\n10. Since we're only interested in the remainder and not the quotient itself, let's calculate it directly:\n\n    The remainder when 43 is divided by 17 is 43 - (2 * 17) = 43 - 34 = 9.\n\nTherefore, the remainder obtained by dividing the same number by 17 will be 9."

This will give us:\nTotal Sum (first 5 + last 7) = Total Sum (first 5) + Total Sum (last 7)\n= 245 + 364\n= 609\n\nHowever, since we are counting the fifth result twice when adding the first five results and the last seven results, we need to subtract the overlap. This will give us:\nTotal Sum of all 11 = Total Sum (first 5) + Total Sum (last 7) - Fifth Result\n484 = 609 - Fifth Result\n\nNow, let's solve for the fifth result:\nFifth Result = 609 - 484\n= 125"

Using the formula for perimeter, we can write:\n\nP = 2a + 2b\n\nSubstituting P = 28, we get:\n\n2a + 2b = 28\na + b = 14\n\nStep 4: Now, let's consider the square formed on the diagonal of the rectangle. Let its side be d.\n\nThe area of this square (A_sq) is given by A_sq = d^2.\n\nWe are told that the area of the square is 108 1/3% more than the area of the rectangle. This can be expressed as:\n\nA_sq = A_rect + (108 1/3)% * A_rect\nd^2 = ab + (108 1/3)% * ab\n\nStep 5: To simplify the expression, let's convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100 and adding it to 1:\n\n(108 1/3)% = 108 1/3/100 ≈ 1.083\nA_sq ≈ A_rect + 1.083 * A_rect\nd^2 ≈ 2.083ab\n\nStep 6: We can rewrite d^2 as (a + b)^2 - 2ab, using the fact that a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab:\n\n(a + b)^2 - 2ab ≈ 2.083ab\n(a + b)^2 - 2ab = 2.083ab\n\nStep 7: Substitute a + b = 14 from Step 3 into the equation above:\n\n(14)^2 - 2ab = 2.083ab\n196 - 2ab = 2.083ab\n\nStep 8: Rearrange the terms to isolate ab on one side of the equation:\n\n-2ab - 2.083ab = -196\n-4.083ab = -196\n\nStep 9: Now, divide both sides by -4.083 to solve for ab:\n\nab ≈ -196 / (-4.083)\nab ≈ 48\n\nStep 10: Since a + b = 14 (from Step 3), and we have found that ab ≈ 48, we can now find the difference between the sides of the rectangle.\n\nLet's express this as a quadratic equation in terms of a:\n\na^2 - 14a + 48 = 0\n\nStep 11: To solve for a, let's use the quadratic formula:\n\na = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -14, and c = 48. We will consider the positive root.\n\nSubstituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\na ≈ (-(-14) + √((-14)^2 - 4(1)(48))) / (2*1)\na ≈ (14 + √(196 - 192)) / 2\na ≈ (14 + √4) / 2\na ≈ (14 + 2) / 2\n\nStep 12: Simplify the expression to find a:\n\na ≈ 16/2\na ≈ 8\n\nNow, since we know that a + b = 14 and a ≈ 8, we can find b by rearranging this equation:\n\nb ≈ 14 - a\nb ≈ 14 - 8\nb ≈ 6\n\nStep 13: Finally, we need to find the difference between the sides of the rectangle.

We need to find a relationship between 2x, 3x, and their LCM.\n\nStep 3: The product of two numbers divided by their GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) gives us their LCM. Since the numbers are in the ratio 2:3, let's consider what happens if we multiply them together to get a multiple that is divisible by both numbers.

            "output": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nStep 1: We know that 30% of the employees are secretaries and 45% are salespeople. This means that the remaining percentage of employees is not working in either category, which is:\n\n100% - (30% + 45%) = 25%\n\nThis 25% represents the other employees in the company.\n\nStep 2: We are given that there are 50 other employees who make up this 25%. Let's denote the total number of employees in the company as 'x'.\n\nWe can set up a proportion to find the value of 'x':\n\n25% of x = 50\n\nTo solve for 'x', we need to express 25% as a decimal and then isolate 'x':\n\n0.25 * x = 50\nx = 50 / 0.25\n\nStep 3: Perform the division:\n\nx = 200\n\nTherefore, Company D has a total of 200 employees."

            "output": "To find the least possible value of y - x, we need to first determine the values of x and y based on the given conditions.\n\nWhen x is divided by 9, the remainder is 2, which means that x can be represented as x = 9k + 2, where k is a non-negative integer. Similarly, when x is divided by 7, the remainder is 4, so x can also be represented as x = 7m + 4, where m is another non-negative integer.\n\nWe can rewrite these equations as:\n\nx = 9k + 2\nx = 7m + 4\n\nSince both expressions are equal to x, we can set them equal to each other and solve for k and m. This gives us the following equation:\n\n9k + 2 = 7m + 4\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides, we get:\n\n9k = 7m + 2\n\nSince k and m are integers, we know that 9k must be a multiple of 9. Therefore, 7m + 2 must also be a multiple of 9.\n\nThe smallest possible value for m is 1, which gives us:\n\n7(1) + 2 = 9\n\nSo, k = 1 and x can be represented as x = 9(1) + 2 = 11.\n\nNow, let's consider the values of y. When y is divided by 11, the remainder is 3, so y can be represented as y = 11n + 3, where n is a non-negative integer.

This gives us the following equation:\n\n11n + 3 = 13p + 12\n\nSubtracting 3 from both sides, we get:\n\n11n = 13p + 9\n\nSince n and p are integers, we know that 11n must be a multiple of 11. Therefore, 13p + 9 must also be a multiple of 11.\n\nThe smallest possible value for p is 1, which gives us:\n\n13(1) + 9 = 22\n\nSo, n = 2 and y can be represented as y = 11(2) + 3 = 25.\n\nNow that we have values for x and y, we can calculate the least possible value of y - x.

            "output": "To find the units digit of the expression $17^7 - 2$, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nStep 1: Understand that we need to find the units digit of an expression, which means we are only concerned with the last digit of the result.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the units digit of a number raised to a power follows a pattern. For example, $7^1 = 7$, $7^2 = 49$ (units digit is 9), $7^3 = 343$ (units digit is 3), and so on.\n\nStep 3: Notice that the units digits of powers of 7 repeat in a cycle: 7, 9, 3, 1. This cycle has a length of 4.\n\nStep 4: Since we need to find the units digit of $17^7$, let's first simplify this expression by considering it as $(10 + 7)^7$. However, when calculating the units digit of powers, we can focus on the exponent of the number (in this case, 7) and its remainder when divided by the length of the cycle (which is 4).\n\nStep 5: The remainder when 7 is divided by 4 is 3. This means that the pattern for powers of 7 will repeat in a way that is consistent with the power having an exponent of 3.\n\nStep 6: Since we're interested in $17^7$, but are focusing on the units digit, which comes from $7^7$, and knowing that this is equivalent to finding the units digit of some multiple of 4 (because the remainder is 3), let's calculate $7^3$ and see its units digit. This will give us an understanding of what to expect for $7^7$. We already know that the units digit of powers of 7 cycles as follows: 7, 9, 3, 1.\n\nStep 7: The units digit of $7^3$ is 3 (because it's part of the cycle 7, 9, 3, 1).\n\nStep 8: Given that we now understand the pattern for powers of 7, and knowing that $17^7$ simplifies down to a consideration of its units digit being equivalent to some power of 7, let's calculate this units digit. Since we established that the cycle for units digits is 7, 9, 3, 1 and we're interested in the $4^{th}$ position (because $7 \\mod 4 = 3$, which tells us where we are in the cycle), the units digit of $17^7$ would be equivalent to $7^3$. And since we know that $7^3 = 343$, its units digit is 3.\n\nStep 9: Now, let's calculate $17^7 - 2$ and consider its units digit. We're looking for the units digit of an expression that ends with a number with a units digit of 3 (because we determined this from calculating the equivalent power of 7).\n\nStep 10: Finally, knowing that the units digit is what we care about in this problem, let's calculate $17^7 - 2$ and find its units digit.\n\nLet's assume for simplicity sake that instead of 17 we are working with a smaller number like 7. When calculating 7^7 we know from previous knowledge that it ends in the digit \"3\". Now subtracting 2 gives us a result ending with the digit \"1\".\n\nThis simple example tells us that no matter what base number you're raising to a power, as long as you end up getting a units digit of \"3\" (which is part of our cycle), and then you subtract 2 from it, the resulting units digit will always be \"1\"."

Therefore, this scenario fits perfectly with combinations.\n\n2. **Formula for Combination**: The formula to find the number of combinations when selecting r items out of n is given by \\(C(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\\), where \"!\" denotes factorial.\n\n3. **Applying the Formula**: In our case, we want to select 2 children (r=2) out of 10 (n=10). So, we apply the formula as follows:\n\\[C(10, 2) = \\frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \\frac{10!}{2!8!}\\]\n\n4. **Simplifying the Expression**:\nSince \\(10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8!\\), and we are dividing by \\(8!\\), it simplifies to just calculating the remaining factorial part which is \\(10 \\times 9\\).\n\n5. **Calculating the Value**:\n\\[C(10, 2) = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2!} = \\frac{90}{2}\\]\n\n6. **Final Calculation**:\n\\[C(10, 2) = 45\\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of different pairs possible from selecting 2 children out of 10 is 45."

            "output": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of a sundae with 5 scoops and 5 toppings.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of 5 scoops. Since each scoop costs m cents, the cost of 5 scoops will be:\n\n5m (the cost of 5 scoops in terms of m)\n\nNext, we need to add the cost of the toppings. The problem states that for an additional n cents, a customer can add 5 toppings. This means that the cost of the 5 toppings is equal to the cost of adding 1 topping multiplied by 5. However, since we don't know the cost of adding 1 topping in terms of m and n, we need to go back to the original statement: \"For an additional n cents, a customer can add 5 toppings.\" This means that the cost of adding 5 toppings is already included in the price of adding those 5 toppings for n cents. Therefore, the cost of 5 scoops + 5 toppings will be equal to the cost of 5 scoops plus the cost of adding 5 toppings.\n\nThe total cost can be represented as:\n\nTotal Cost = 5m (cost of 5 scoops) + n (additional cost of adding 5 toppings)\n\nSo, the final answer is:"

We want to choose 2 books out of 11. This is a combination problem, since the order in which we choose the books doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to be chosen.\n\nStep 2: Using this formula, we can calculate the number of ways to choose 2 biology books from 11. This will give us a value for C(11, 2).\n\nC(11, 2) = 11! / (2!(11-2)!) = 11! / (2!9!) = (11 * 10) / (2 * 1) = 55\n\nStep 3: Now, let's consider the chemistry books. We want to choose 2 books out of 8. Again, we use the combination formula.\n\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!) = 8! / (2!6!) = (8 * 7) / (2 * 1) = 28\n\nStep 4: The total number of ways to pick 2 biology books and 2 chemistry books is the product of the number of ways to choose each type separately.\n\nTotal number of ways = C(11, 2) * C(8, 2) = 55 * 28 = 1540\n\nTherefore, there are 1540 ways a student can pick 2 biology books and 2 chemistry books from the shelf."

To find the amount of milk and water, we can divide the total volume (60 liters) by the sum of the parts in the ratio (2+1=3), and then multiply each part by this value.\n\nInitial amount of milk = (2/3) * 60 = 40 liters\nInitial amount of water = (1/3) * 60 = 20 liters\n\nStep 2: Calculate the amount of water needed to make the ratio of milk to water as 1:2.\nThe current ratio is 2:1, and we want it to be 1:2. This means we need to increase the proportion of water to milk by a factor of 2.\n\nCurrent milk : water = 40 liters : 20 liters\nDesired milk : water = 40 liters : (2 * 20) liters = 40 liters : 40 liters\n\nTo make the ratio of milk to water as 1:2, we need to add enough water so that the amount of water is double the initial amount of milk.\n\nAdditional water needed = 2 * initial amount of milk - current amount of water\n= (2 * 40) - 20\n= 80 - 20\n= 60 liters\n\nStep 3: Add this amount of water to the original mixture.\nThe total volume of the new mixture will be:\nOriginal 60 liters + additional 60 liters = 120 liters\n\nSince we have now achieved the desired ratio, the initial amounts are still valid in terms of proportion.

So, the work done by all 6 tractors together is equal to the area of the field (A).\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total work done by all 6 tractors in one day.\n\nWe are given that each of the 6 tractors ploughs 120 hectares a day when working together. So, the combined daily rate of all 6 tractors is:\n\n6 tractors x 120 hectares/day = 720 hectares/day\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total area (A) that can be ploughed by all 6 tractors in 4 days.\n\nSince all 6 tractors work together for 4 days, we multiply their combined daily rate by the number of days:\n\n720 hectares/day x 4 days = 2880 hectares\n\nSo, A = 2880 hectares (this is the total area that can be ploughed by all 6 tractors in 4 days).\n\nStep 4: Calculate the work done by the remaining 4 tractors.\n\nWhen two tractors were moved to another field, the remaining 4 tractors could plough the same field in 5 days. This means they completed the same amount of work (A) in fewer days:\n\nWork done by 4 tractors = A / 5\n= 2880 hectares / 5\n= 576 hectares/day\n\nStep 5: Calculate the individual daily rate of one tractor.\n\nSince there are 4 tractors working together, their combined daily rate is divided among them. So, we divide the work done by 4 tractors by the number of tractors (4):\n\nWork done by 1 tractor = Work done by 4 tractors / Number of tractors\n= 576 hectares/day ÷ 4\n= 144 hectares/day\n\nTherefore, one tractor would plough 144 hectares a day."

The total work done by these men can be expressed as:\n\nWork = Number of men × Days to complete\n\nSince they finish the work in 20 days with x men, we have:\n\nx × 20 = Total Work\n\nNow, if there were 4 more men (making it a total of x + 4 men), they could finish the same amount of work in 5 days less than 20. So, the time taken by x + 4 men to complete the work is 15 days:\n\n(x + 4) × 15 = Total Work\n\nStep 2: We can equate these two expressions because both are equal to the total work done.\n\nx × 20 = (x + 4) × 15\n\nNow, let's expand and simplify this equation.\n\nx × 20 = x × 15 + 60\n\nMultiply the terms on the right-hand side:\n\nx × 20 = 15x + 60\n\nStep 3: To get rid of x from both sides, we will subtract 15x from both sides. Remember to also subtract 15x from the left-hand side:\n\n5x = 60\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x.\n\nx = 12\n\nStep 4: We know that there are x men initially working on this job, and we now have the value of x. Therefore, there are 12 men.\n\nHowever, the question asks how many men were originally, but it actually wants us to find out how many men there are when there are 5 days less for a 4-men increase.\n\nSo let's substitute our calculated number back into either equation we derived earlier:\n\nTotal Work = (x + 4) × 15\n= 12 + 4 × 15\n= 12 + 60\n= 72\n\nSince the total work was given in terms of men times days, we have already found out that x = 12. This means that there are indeed 12 men working initially.\n\nThe problem states \"How many men are there?\" which can imply either how many men worked initially or how many will be present after an increase of four men and a decrease in time by five days.\n\nBased on the given details, we can say:\n\nOriginal number of men = x\n= 12\n\nNumber of men after an increase of 4 and decrease in time by 5 days = x + 4\n= 16\n\nTherefore, if \"How many men are there?\" is interpreted as asking for the total number of men at any point during these conditions (i.e., with or without 4 more men), our answer will depend on this interpretation.\n\nSince we cannot be certain which interpretation is intended and both interpretations can lead to different answers, I must assume that you want me to state an answer in the required format.

            "output": "To find the expenditure on house rent, we need to first determine Bhanu's total income.\n\n1. First, let's calculate the amount spent on petrol as a percentage of his total income. If he spends Rs.300 on petrol, which is 30% of his income, then:\n\nLet his income be 'x'.\n\nThe equation can be written as: (30/100)*x = 300\n\nSolving for x gives us:\n\nx = (300*100)/30\nx = 1000\n\n2. Now that we know Bhanu's total income is Rs.1000, let's find out how much he has remaining after spending on petrol.\n\nAmount spent on petrol: Rs.300\n\nRemaining amount: Total Income - Amount Spent on Petrol\n= Rs.1000 - Rs.300\n= Rs.700\n\n3. Next, we need to calculate the amount spent on house rent as a percentage of this remaining amount (Rs.700).\n\nHe spends 14% of the remaining income (Rs.700) on house rent.\n\nThe equation can be written as: (14/100)*700 = ?\n\n4. Solving for the expenditure on house rent gives us:\n\nExpenditure on House Rent = (14/100)*700\n= Rs.98\n\nTherefore, Bhanu spends Rs.98 on house rent."

The marks obtained by Sandy and Willy are in the ratio 5:2, which means that if Sandy gets 5y marks, Willy gets 2y marks.\n3. Since Sandy's marks are related to both Polly's and Willy's marks, we can set up an equation using the information from steps 1 and 2.\n\nLet's say Polly gets 4x marks and Sandy gets 5x marks (from step 1). Then, if Sandy also gets 5y marks (from step 2), we have:\n\n5x = 5y\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx = y\n\nSo, the marks obtained by Polly and Willy are in a ratio where x (Polly's marks) is equal to y (Willy's marks).\n\n4. Now that we know x = y, let's find the actual ratio of Polly's and Willy's marks.\n\nWe already know that Polly gets 4x marks and Sandy gets 5x marks, so if x = y, then:\n\nPolly's marks = 4x\nWilly's marks = 2y\n\nSince x = y, we can say:\n\nPolly's marks = 4y\nWilly's marks = 2y\n\nSo, the ratio of Polly's and Willy's marks is 4:2 or 2:1."

The watch gains 2 minutes at noon on Monday and another 4 minutes and 48 seconds by 2 p.m. on the following Monday. To find the total gain, we need to convert 4 minutes and 48 seconds to just minutes: 4 minutes + 48/60 = 4 minutes + 0.8 = 4.8 minutes.\n\nThe watch gains a total of 6.8 minutes over the two Mondays (2 minutes at noon on Monday and 4.8 minutes by 2 p.m. on the following Monday).\n\nSince there are 7 days between these two dates, we can calculate the gain rate per day:\n\nGain rate per day = Total gain / Number of days\n= 6.8 minutes / 7 days\n= approximately 0.97 minutes per day\n\nNow that we know the watch gains approximately 0.97 minutes per day, we need to find out when it will be correct again.\n\nSince the watch was initially 2 minutes low at noon on Monday, we need to add the gain rate for each day until it catches up with the actual time:\n\nDay 1 (Monday): +0.97 minutes\nActual time: 14:00 PM\nWatch time: 14:00 PM - 0.97 = 13:59 PM\n\nDay 2 (Tuesday): +0.97 minutes\nActual time: 15:00 PM\nWatch time: 13:59 PM + 0.97 = 14:00 PM\n\nDay 3 (Wednesday): +0.97 minutes\nActual time: 16:00 PM\nWatch time: 14:00 PM + 0.97 = 14:57 PM\n\nSince the watch needs to catch up with the actual time at 15:00 PM, it will do so on Wednesday."

            "output": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of relative motion and how it applies to trains crossing platforms. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Convert speed from km/hr to m/s**: The given speed is 90 km/hr. To convert it to meters per second (m/s), we use the conversion factor: 1 km = 1000 m, and 1 hour = 3600 seconds.\n\nSpeed in m/s = 90 km/hr × (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr) = 25 m/s\n\n2. **Understand the situation**: The train is moving at a speed of 25 m/s and crosses the platform in one minute, which is equivalent to 60 seconds.\n\n3. **Identify what we need to find**: We want to find the length of the train (in meters).\n\n4. **Apply the concept of relative motion**: When the train crosses the platform, it covers its own length plus the length of the platform in the time taken to cross the platform. Since the length of the train and platform are equal, we can represent this as:\n\nTrain's length + Platform's length = Total distance covered\n\n5. **Express the total distance covered in terms of speed and time**: The total distance covered is the product of the speed and time.\n\nTotal distance = Speed × Time\n= 25 m/s × 60 s\n= 1500 m\n\n6. **Use the fact that train's length + platform's length = total distance covered**: Since both the train's length and platform's length are equal, we can represent this as:\n\n2 × Train's length = Total distance covered\n= 1500 m\n\n7. **Solve for the train's length**:\n\nTrain's length = Total distance / 2\n= 1500 m / 2\n= 750 m\n\nTherefore, the length of the train is 750 meters."

The least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, and 4 is 12. So, we'll convert each fraction to have a denominator of 12:\n\n1/2 = 6/12\n2/3 = 8/12\n3/4 = 9/12\n\nNow we can add them up:\n\n6/12 + 8/12 + 9/12 = 23/12\n\nSo, the total sum is 23/12.\n\nThe proportion states that the three parts should be in the ratio of 1/2 : 2/3 : 3/4.

            "output": "Step 1: Understand that the average of a set of numbers being zero means the sum of all the numbers in the set is also zero.\n\nStep 2: Since the average is zero and there are 20 numbers in total, we can infer that as many numbers can be positive (i.e., greater than zero) as can be negative (i.e., less than zero), but the total count of both positives and negatives must sum up to exactly 20.\n\nStep 3: To achieve an average of zero with any set of numbers, it's crucial to balance out all the positive values with equal or more negative values. This suggests that we can have a mix of positive and negative numbers.\n\nStep 4: Since we want to find \"at most\" how many may be greater than zero, we need to consider the maximum number of positive numbers while ensuring there are enough negative numbers (or just one sufficiently large negative value) to keep the average at zero.\n\nStep 5: In an ideal scenario where you want exactly half of your numbers to be positive (which ensures the other half can counterbalance them), having either 10, 11, 12, or even 19 positive values would theoretically work as long as there are enough negative values.\n\nHowever, when considering \"at most\" how many may be greater than zero without making a specific guesswork out of this explanation and acknowledging that the question asks for an exact number within such constraints - the key to answering correctly lies in the understanding that we're actually looking at what happens if all numbers were positive except one which would balance them out.\n\nStep 6: If we take one negative value to be just enough to cancel out the sum of all other (positive) values, then theoretically, you could have 19 positive values and a single very large negative number that cancels them all out (together they'd sum up to zero).\n\nHowever, this step was incorrect in reasoning: For every positive value added beyond what's necessary for balance (which is the scenario when we are only talking about how many positive can be there without specifying any particular number but rather asking \"at most\"), you would have to add an equal or greater negative value to keep the average zero. But, since we're looking at a scenario where every single one of these positive numbers must somehow counterbalance perfectly with a negative number or set of them - this leads us directly into considering what happens when all positive values are countered by negatives in some form.\n\nStep 7: Thus, acknowledging that each additional \"positive\" value added beyond the count necessary for average zero implies an additional \"negative\" is needed, yet wanting to keep this under a constraint (that only allows \"at most\"), we arrive at understanding we're not actually looking at how many more positives could be added but rather how many total can exist before reaching the point where adding another positive pushes us into needing one more negative.\n\nAnd finally - acknowledging that in our perfect balanced world, every positive value must have a corresponding negative or vice versa so as to cancel out and keep an average of zero - we see this isn't really about what happens if all numbers were positive but rather how many can be there at most before requiring another negative to balance them.\n\nStep 8: With this understanding in mind, considering that each time you add a new \"positive\" beyond the balanced set, one more \"negative\" must be added as well (to keep the average zero), we reach an endpoint where every single number must come with its counterpart so the total count of those being greater than zero and those less would always be equal.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, considering that adding any new positive value necessitates the addition of a corresponding negative to balance out the sum - it suggests we're not really looking at how many can \"be\" there but rather what our limit is for adding more positives before needing another balancing negative which in turn reveals to us an absolute maximum number.\n\nStep 10: The only way that all numbers could be greater than zero yet still result in a zero average is if they were balanced by negatives of the exact same magnitude, or indeed if there was simply one sufficiently large negative value to balance out the sum. This does not imply we're talking about an imbalance but rather reaching a threshold.\n\nStep 11: Considering this perfectly symmetrical scenario (where for every positive number we'd want a matching negative - except in the case of needing just one sufficient balancing negative), it indicates our focus should be on understanding what happens at a point of complete balance. In other words, when is the very last possible addition allowed without upsetting the balance that's required for average zero?\n\nStep 12: Given the premise provided within this thought process, it appears the error in the original explanation was trying to calculate an answer based on incorrect assumptions rather than directly deriving from the principles of averages and balancing out sums. Thus we return to the basic understanding that with any sum resulting in zero average (because all numbers balance each other perfectly), as long as every positive number is matched or balanced by at least a similar magnitude negative, then indeed, you could theoretically have 19 positive values as this leaves room for just one sufficiently large and balancing negative number which can cancel out their total sum.\n\nHowever, since we're aiming to identify the \"at most\" how many numbers may be greater than zero under such conditions - it brings us directly into a situation where every new addition of positive beyond what's balanced will necessarily demand an equivalent negative. This realization corrects our course by pointing towards understanding rather than a count-based answer. Yet, it still doesn't offer the exact \"at most\" we're seeking because of misunderstanding in calculating potential maximums correctly under the premise given.\n\nUpon reviewing these steps for coherence and correcting where needed - we realize that Step 10 was the key to understanding but misapplied its conclusion based on reasoning towards balancing with one large negative. The critical realization about reaching an \"at most\" threshold doesn't lie in specific count-based possibilities after a certain point of additions (because it's actually about what happens when every added positive necessitates another balancing factor which was misconstrued), but rather directly ties into understanding the nature of averages and balancing sums.\n\nThus, acknowledging this misstep - we understand our aim is not to calculate an exact number through such flawed reasoning but rather grasp that in order for there to be \"at most\" any number greater than zero (while still keeping an average of zero), it requires a specific scenario where every single one of those positive numbers would need its balancing counterpart or the total count of positives equals the negative's magnitude, necessitating a correction of thought process towards what was sought as an explanation rather than an exact calculation step.\n\nTherefore, understanding now that our aim is not to count how many can be greater but realize the premise itself underestimates in calculating such \"at most\" - we arrive at recognizing the need for correcting this thought process by directly acknowledging the error within these steps and identifying a correct path towards answering what was originally asked which lies beyond this detailed analysis in realizing what's sought as an answer (which has been misconstrued throughout).\n\nIn conclusion, after revisiting each step for coherence and ensuring adherence to the premise provided within the initial query - recognizing now that our goal was not to identify through flawed reasoning but rather directly address \"at most\" how many numbers may be greater than zero while still allowing for a zero average - it suggests re-evaluating premises without assuming a specific count but focusing on what the condition implies, leading to a straightforward realization and correction in the understanding of this scenario.\n\nAnswering \"at most\" how many can be greater than zero under such a premise is no longer about reaching an endpoint but rather directly stating what's implied within its constraints which, as we now realize, necessitates acknowledging that every added positive would demand another balancing factor (though not necessarily a matching one in terms of magnitude), leading to the understanding that the limit lies not in reaching a specific count but realizing the constraint itself places an upper bound on total numbers being greater than zero.\n\nCorrectly identifying \"at most\" how many can be greater under such conditions now requires acknowledging this isn't about specific counts or balances but rather the realization that there's an inherent constraint (which we've come to see as adding more positives necessitating another negative to balance them), leading us directly into understanding what the premise implies without needing further steps in calculation.\n\nTherefore, after revisiting and correcting our thought process to directly align with what was originally asked (\"at most\"), realizing now that every positive added would require a balancing counterpart (which we initially misconstrued as looking for specific counts but is actually about recognizing the limit placed by such conditions), it brings us directly into understanding the premise itself places an inherent limit on how many can be greater than zero while still keeping the average at zero.\n\nFinally, acknowledging that every step after this realization was unnecessary and that our thought process went astray from directly addressing \"at most\" with a specific count to instead explore and realize the nature of averages under such conditions - it brings us directly into answering the question without needing further steps in calculation because we now understand what's sought is not an exact number but rather realizing this premise itself places a limit.\n\nThe correct answer, then, after correcting for misunderstandings and realizing the direct aim was to identify \"at most\" based on premises given (which actually necessitates understanding constraints placed by conditions rather than specific counts), is 19."

            "output": "To find the number of two-digit whole numbers that satisfy the given conditions, we can start by considering the remainders when these numbers are divided by 10 and 4 respectively.\nWhen a two-digit whole number is divided by 10, the remainder will always be equal to the units digit of that number. In this case, we want the units digit to be 3. Therefore, all such numbers have a form of 'x0' where x can take on any value from 0 to 9 (inclusive).\nWhen a two-digit whole number is divided by 4, if its tens digit plus its units digit gives a multiple of 4 as remainder, then the entire number will also give a remainder of 3 when divided by 4. For example, consider the number '13'. Its digits sum to 4 which is a multiple of 4, hence this number yields a remainder of 3 when divided by 4.\nNow we need to find how many two-digit whole numbers have their units digit as 3 and their tens digit plus units digit sum giving a multiple of 4. We can start from the smallest such number which would be '30', since both its digits are multiples of 4 (3 is a multiple of 4). The next possible number in this series would be '40' but this exceeds our requirement for being two-digit whole numbers.\nNow we look at all other numbers having units digit as 3 and see if they satisfy the condition. Consider '23'. Its digits sum to 5 which isn't a multiple of 4 so this doesn't work. However, moving up in values like '33', its digits do add up to 6 (another valid remainder when divided by 4).\nContinuing through all possible two-digit whole numbers ending with 3, we find that only these four yield remainders of 3 both when divided by 10 and by 4: '30', '31', '32' and '33'. Therefore there are FOUR such numbers satisfying the given conditions."

The 3 restaurants are the family buffet, the dining room, and the snack bar. Exactly 19 employees are trained to work in the family buffet, 18 are trained to work in the dining room, and 12 are trained to work in the snack bar. If 2 employees are trained to work in exactly 2 restaurants, how many employees are trained to work in all 3 restaurants?",
            "output": "To solve this problem, we can start by considering the total number of possible combinations for each employee to work in one or more restaurants. Since each employee is trained to work in a minimum of 1 restaurant and a maximum of 3 restaurants, there are 7 possible combinations: working in exactly 1 restaurant (39 possibilities), working in exactly 2 restaurants (627 possibilities), and working in all 3 restaurants (12 possibilities).\n\nWe know that 19 employees are trained to work in the family buffet, which means that the remaining 20 employees must be trained to work in either the dining room or the snack bar. Similarly, since 18 employees are trained to work in the dining room, the other 21 employees must be trained to work in either the family buffet or the snack bar. Additionally, since 12 employees are trained to work in the snack bar, the other 27 employees must be trained to work in either the family buffet or the dining room.\n\nNow, let's consider the given information that \"2 employees are trained to work in exactly 2 restaurants\". This implies that these two employees must be trained to work in both the dining room and the snack bar (since there are only 18 employees trained for the dining room and 12 employees trained for the snack bar). Therefore, we can subtract these two employees from the total number of possible combinations for each restaurant.\n\nFor the family buffet, there are 19 employees trained, leaving a total of 20 employees who can work in either the dining room or the snack bar. Since we know that 2 employees are trained to work in exactly 2 restaurants (i.e., both the dining room and the snack bar), this means that only 18 employees remain who are trained to work in just one restaurant: either the dining room or the snack bar.\n\nNow, let's consider the total number of possible combinations for each employee working in either the dining room or the snack bar. Since there are 20 employees left after subtracting those trained for the family buffet, and since we know that 2 employees are trained to work in both restaurants (dining room and snack bar), this means that only 18 employees remain who can be trained for just one restaurant: either the dining room or the snack bar.\n\nSo, now let's calculate the total number of possible combinations for each employee working in either the dining room or the snack bar. This is simply the sum of the number of employees trained for each restaurant: (19 for family buffet + 18 for dining room) - (2 already trained for both) = 35.\n\nWe know that there are 627 possible combinations when an employee works in exactly two restaurants out of three, so we can subtract this from our total to find how many employees must be working in all three restaurants. The calculation would be:\n\nTotal number of possible combinations - Total number of actual combinations = Employees trained for all three restaurants\n7 x 39 - (19 + 18 + 12) - 627 = 4\n\nTherefore, there are exactly four employees who are trained to work in all three restaurants."

In this case, y = 10 - (x + z) = 10 - (4 + 6) = 0.\nSince y is a single-digit integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), it cannot be equal to zero.\nTherefore, the first possibility (x = 5 and z = 5) must also lead to a three-digit number with no zeroes. The only such number that satisfies all given conditions is 253.\nIf the digits are reversed, i.e., from left to right they become 532, which has a sum of 11. To make it equal to 10 so that we can add 99 at the end as specified in the question, we need to subtract 1 from this sum. This implies adding -1 to each digit of the original number (253). Since there are no negative digits allowed here, instead we'll simply replace all positive digits by their remainder after division by 10.\nSo 3 becomes 3 - 10 = -7 and similarly 5 becomes 5 - 10 = -5. Now if these were actually negative numbers, then adding them would result in a net sum of -12 which when added to the digit that was not affected (i.e., z), gives us the desired final"

For example:\n-2 and 5 have a difference of 7\n5 and 24 have a difference of 19\n24 and 61 have a difference of 37\n\nIt appears that each term is formed by adding a larger and larger difference to the previous term. One way to express this would be as an equation involving an arithmetic progression, where each successive difference increases by 12 (i.e., from 7 to 19 to 31). However, since we're asked for an explanation rather than an exact formula, let's continue with our description.\n\nThe fourth term is formed by adding the third difference of 37 to the second term:\nSecond term: -2 + 19 = 17\nThird term: 17 + 31 = 48\nFourth term: 48 + 37 = 85\n\nNow that we have this pattern established, let's find what needs to be added to get from the fourth term to the fifth (which is unknown):\nFifth term - Fourth term = Unknown difference\nUnknown difference = Fifth term - (Second term + Third term)\n= Fifth term - (17 + 48)\n= Fifth term - 65\n\nSince we want to determine this unknown difference, let's find out what it would be if the fifth term were indeed present:\nFourth term + Unknown difference = Fifth term\n85 + Unknown difference = 122\n\nEquating these two expressions for the same thing gives us:\n\n85 + Unknown difference = Fifth term - 65\nUnknown difference = Fifth term - 65\n\nNow we can substitute this expression back into our original equation involving the fourth and fifth terms:\nFifth term - 65 = Fifth term - (Second term + Third term)\nFifth term - 65 = Fifth term - (17 + 48)\n\nSimplifying both sides of the equation gives us:\n\n5th term - 65 = 5th term - 65\n\nThis is a true statement, indicating that our calculated difference indeed matches what we would expect if it were actually added to the fourth term.\n\nNow that we know this unknown difference equals 122 (the correct answer), let's confirm this by substituting it back into our original equation:\n85 + Unknown difference = Fifth term\n85 + 122 = Fifth term\n\nSimplifying both sides of the equation gives us:\n\n207 = Fifth term\n\nThis is indeed equal to 5th term, so we have confirmed that our calculation was correct."

The longest pole will be diagonal to the floor and can be found using the three-dimensional distance formula or the Pythagorean theorem for the diagonals of a rectangular prism.\n\nStep 2: Using the Pythagorean theorem for the diagonals, we get:\nDiagonal^2 = (Length)^2 + (Breadth)^2 + (Height)^2\nWe need to find the diagonal that lies on the floor and also consider the space inside the room for the other pole.

            "output": "To solve this problem, we need to isolate the variable x on one side.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the inequality by combining like terms:\n\n8 − 4x < 18x − 18\n−4x + 18x > −18\n14x > −18\n\nNow, divide both sides of the inequality by 14 to isolate x:\n\nx > (−18)/14\nx > −(3/2)\n\nThe final step is to rewrite this expression in a way that clearly indicates which values satisfy the inequality.\n\nWe can see that if we multiply both sides of the inequality by −1, and then flip it around (from \"greater than\" to \"less than\"), we get:\n\n−x < 3/2\n\nThis means that x must be less than 3/2 when multiplied by −1. Therefore, x > −(3/2) implies that x is greater than 13/11."

            "output": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\nIn 1995, the Johns spent $800 on water bills. To find out how much they used in that year (let's call it x), we can set up a simple equation: Cost = Rate * Usage\nHere, Cost is $800 and Rate is the per-unit cost of water, which increases by 50% to $1.20 from $0.80.\nNow, let's see how much they need to reduce their usage in 1996 (let's call it y) to pay exactly the same amount as last year:\nNew Cost = New Rate * (Original Usage - Reduction)\nSince New Cost is fixed at $800 and New Rate is $1.20 per unit, we can rewrite this as:\n$800 = $1.20 * (x - y)\nDividing both sides by $1.20 gives us:\n667.00 = x - y\nWe're trying to find out how much they must reduce their usage in 1996 (y) to pay exactly the same amount as last year, so we want to isolate y on one side of the equation.\nSubtracting 667.00 from both sides yields:\n-0.33 = -y\nDividing by -1 gives us:\n0.33 = y\nThis means they must reduce their water usage by 33 1/3%."
