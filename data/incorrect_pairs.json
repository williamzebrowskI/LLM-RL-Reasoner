        "rationale": "Step 1: Let's denote the number of shelves on the 1st floor as x.\nSince there are half as many shelves on the 2nd floor as on the 1st, the number of shelves on the 2nd floor is also x/2.\n\nStep 2: The total number of shelves in the library is x + x/2 = (3x)/2.\nNow we need to calculate the ratio of books per shelf on both floors. Given that there are 5/6 as many books per shelf on the 2nd floor than on the 1st, and the first floor has 'a' number of books per shelf, then:\n\nThe second floor's books per shelf = (5/6) * a\n\nStep 3: Now we know that if there are x shelves on the 1st floor with 'a' books per shelf, the total number of books on the 1st floor is xa.\nOn the other hand, since there are half as many shelves on the 2nd floor (x/2), and each shelf contains (5/6) * a books:\n\nThe total number of books on the 2nd floor = ((5/6)*a) * (x/2)\n\nStep 4: We can simplify this expression by combining terms, which will give us the fraction of the library's books that are on the first floor.\n\nStep 5: The total number of shelves is (3x)/2 and the second floor has x/2 shelves.

        "question": "A sum of Rs.63000 is divided into three parts such that the simple interests accrued on them for three, six and nine years respectively may be equal. Find the amount deposited for 3 years.",
        "rationale": "Step 1: Let's assume the amounts deposited for 3, 6, and 9 years are P, Q, and R respectively.\nStep 2: The simple interest (SI) accrued on these amounts can be calculated using the formula SI = (P * T * R)/100, where P is the principal amount, T is the time period in years, and R is the rate of interest per year.\nStep 3: We are given that the SI accrued on each part for three, six, and nine years respectively may be equal. Therefore, we can set up the following equations:\n   - For 3 years: SI_3 = (P * 3 * R)/100\n   - For 6 years: SI_6 = (Q * 6 * R)/100\n   - For 9 years: SI_9 = (R * 9 * R)/100\nStep 4: Since the SI for each period is equal, we can set up an equation using the formulae derived above:\n   P * 3 * R / 100 = Q * 6 * R / 100 = R * 9 * R / 100\nStep 5: To simplify the calculation, let's consider that the rate of interest (R) is the same for all three parts.\nStep 6: The amounts deposited for each part can be calculated using the following steps:\n   - First, calculate the ratio of Q to P. Since SI_3 = SI_6, we have P * 3 * R / 100 = Q * 6 * R / 100\n   - Simplifying this equation gives us Q/P = (SI_3)/(SI_6) = 2/1.\nStep 7: Similarly, the ratio of R to Q can be calculated using SI_6 = SI_9. This gives us Q/R = 4/3.\nStep 8: To find P/Q, we need to find the common multiple of 2 and 4. The least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 4 is 4.\nStep 9: Now that we have a ratio between R and Q, we can use this information to determine the amount deposited for 3 years.\n\nNow let's find the amount deposited for 3 years:\nLet's assume x represents P. Using Q/P = 2/1 and R/Q = 4/3, we get:\nR/Q = (Q/P) * (P/R) = 8/3.\nStep 10: We know that Q + P + R = 63000 (total amount). Substituting Q as 2P and R as (12P)/5 in the equation gives us the sum of P, Q, and R. Therefore,\n   P + 2P + ((12P)/5) = 63000\nStep 11: Multiplying the entire equation by 5 to clear the denominator yields:\n   5P + 10P + 12P = 315000\nStep 12: Combining like terms and simplifying this equation results in a new equation with P as the variable.\n\nSimplifying the equation further, we get:\n27P = 315000.\nStep 13: Now that we have an equation representing only one variable (P), we can solve for P by isolating it on one side of the equation. Divide both sides of this equation by 27 to find P:\n\n\nAnswer: $15555",

Since the senior class is twice the size of the junior class, the number of seniors will be 2x.\n\nStep 2: We know that 3/8 of the seniors and 1/4 of the juniors study Japanese. So, we can calculate the number of students studying Japanese in each class.\n- Number of seniors studying Japanese = (3/8) * 2x = (6/8)x = (3/4)x\n- Number of juniors studying Japanese = (1/4)x\n\nStep 3: To find the total fraction of students studying Japanese, we need to add the number of seniors and juniors studying Japanese and divide it by the total number of students.\n- Total number of students = x + 2x = 3x\n- Total number of students studying Japanese = (3/4)x + (1/4)x = (1/4)(3x + 1)x\nSince we need to simplify this expression, let's calculate the numerator:\n(3x + 1)\nNow we can divide it by the denominator:\nTotal fraction = ((3x + 1)/4)x / 3x\n\nStep 4: Simplify the total fraction.\nTotal fraction = (3x + 1)/12x * x\nTotal fraction = (3x + 1)/12\n\n\nThe final answer is not in its simplest form, so let's simplify it further:\nLet's find a common denominator for the two fractions in the numerator and then combine them:\n\n\nStep 5: Let's find a common denominator for the two fractions.

        "question": "If there are only 2 wheelers and 4 wheelers parked in a school located at the heart of the city, find the number of 4 wheelers parked there if the total number of wheels is 66?",
        "rationale": "Let's denote the number of 2-wheelers as x and the number of 4-wheelers as y.\n\nSince each 2-wheeler has 2 wheels and each 4-wheeler has 4 wheels, we can set up an equation based on the total number of wheels:\n\n2x + 4y = 66\n\nWe are also given that there are only 2-wheelers and 4-wheelers parked in the school. This means x and y must be whole numbers (you can't have a fraction of a vehicle!).\n\nSince each 2-wheeler has an even number of wheels, we know that the total number of wheels is even. Therefore, the right-hand side of our equation, 66, must also be even.\n\nThis allows us to simplify our equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\nx + 2y = 33\n\nNow, let's think about the possibilities for x and y. We know that x (the number of 2-wheelers) must be less than or equal to 33 (since we can't have a negative number of vehicles!). Similarly, y (the number of 4-wheelers) must also be less than or equal to 33.\n\nWe can start by trying small values for x. Let's say x = 1 (i.e., there is only one 2-wheeler parked). In this case:\n\ny = (33 - x)/2\n= (33 - 1)/2\n= 32/2\n= 16\n\nThis means that if we have only one 2-wheeler, we would need to have exactly 16 4-wheelers.\n\nHowever, this seems unlikely. If there is only one 2-wheeler and 16 4-wheelers parked in the school, it's likely that we could easily find more than 17 2-wheelers (since each school has multiple students who drive 2-wheelers to get there!).\n\nLet's try a slightly larger value for x. Suppose there are exactly 5 2-wheelers parked:\n\ny = (33 - x)/2\n= (33 - 5)/2\n= 28/2\n= 14\n\nThis means that if we have five 2-wheelers, we would need to have exactly 14 4-wheelers.\n\nNow, let's think about the total number of vehicles parked. We have 5 2-wheelers and 14 4-wheelers. The total number of wheels for these vehicles is:\n\n2x + 4y\n= (2)(5) + (4)(14)\n= 10 + 56\n= 66\n\nThis matches our initial equation! \n\nSince we've found a solution where x = 5 and y = 14, it looks like there are indeed five 2-wheelers parked in the school.\n\nAnswer: 14",

        "rationale": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how numbers are raised to a power and how the last digit is affected.\n\nWhen a number is raised to a power, the last digit of the result can be predicted using certain patterns. For example, when raising 2 to various powers, the last digits follow a pattern: 2^1 = 2 (last digit is 2), 2^2 = 4 (last digit is 4), 2^3 = 8 (last digit is 8), 2^4 = 16 (last digit is 6), and so on.\n\nSimilarly, when raising other numbers to powers, specific patterns emerge. For instance, the last digits of 5 raised to various powers are always 5.\n\nNow, let's examine the given expressions:\n\n1. (23__)^32\n2. (12__)^33\n\nWe're told that both results have a '6' in the last digit. To identify the missing digit, we need to find two numbers of the form 23x and 12y such that when raised to the specified powers, their last digits are both '6'.\n\nFor (23x)^32:\n\nIf x = 5, then 23^32 would have a last digit of 6 because the pattern for raising 2 to various powers results in repeating last digits: 2, 4, 8, 6, and so on.\n\nFor (12y)^33:\n\nWhen y = 3, 12^33 has a last digit of 6. This is due to the fact that raising any power of 12 will always have a last digit of either 1 or 2 (or their multiples).\n\nHowever, we're not done yet! We still need to confirm whether both numbers result in a '6' as their last digits when raised to those powers.\n\nFor x = 5:\n\n23^32 indeed ends with 6 (after checking the pattern for raising 2 to various powers).\n\nAnd for y = 3:\n\n12^33 also ends with 6 (by applying the same principles, considering that any power of 12 results in a last digit of either 1 or 2).\n\nThus, based on these observations and calculations, we've found that both x = 5 and y = 3 meet the conditions stated.\n\nSince there are no other options given for possible answers, it seems that the question is hinting towards this unique combination as the solution. Therefore, our final answer should reflect both values.\n\nAnswer: The missing digits in both (23__)^32 and (12__)^33 expressions are 5.",

If the number is a power of a two-digit number, then we must find that power which has 6 in its unit place.\n\nWe know that $2^5=32$ and $3^7=(10+3)^7=(10\\text{ units})+(7\\times 3 +1\\times0)\\text { tens}.$ Hence for a number of the form $(xy)_n$, we can write it as $(10x+y)_n$.

This means that the difference between their income and expenditure is equal to the amount they save. So, for Lakshmi, we have:\n5x - 3y = 6000\nAnd for Latha, we have:\n4x - 4y = 6000\n\nStep 4: We can simplify these equations by dividing both sides of each equation by their respective GCDs.\nFor the first equation, the GCD is 1. So, no simplification is needed.\n\nFor the second equation, the GCD is 4. After simplifying:\nx - y = 1500\n\nStep 5: Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve these equations using either substitution or elimination method.\nHere, let's use the elimination method. To eliminate y, we will multiply the first equation by 1 (the multiplier for elimination) and the second equation by 3 to get:\n5x - 3y = 6000\nAnd,\n3(4x - 4y) = 3(6000)\nStep 6: After simplifying the second equation, we have:\n12x - 12y = 18000\n\nStep 7: Now, add both equations to eliminate y.\n(5x + 12x) - (3y + 12y) = 6000 + 18000\n17x - 15y = 21000\n\nStep 8: Divide the equation from step 4 by 1 and multiply it by -15 for elimination.\n\n(-15)(x - y) = (-15)(1500)\n-15x + 15y = -22500\n\nStep 9: Add both equations to eliminate x.\n(17x - 15x) + (-3y - 12y + 15y) = 21000 - 22500\n2x -6y = -15000\n\n\nStep 10: Now, we have the equation with one variable (y).

        "question": "A is twice as good a work man as B and together they finish the work in 12 days. In how many days A alone can finish the work?",
        "rationale": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Let's assume that the rate at which B works is x units per day. Since A is twice as good a worker as B, the rate at which A works is 2x units per day.\n\n2. Together, they finish the work in 12 days. This means that their combined rate of work is equal to the total amount of work divided by the number of days it takes them to complete the work.\n\n3. The combined rate of work for A and B is (2x + x) = 3x units per day.\n\n4. Since they finish the work in 12 days, their combined rate of work is equal to the total amount of work divided by 12:\n\n   3x = Total amount of work / 12\n\n5. Let's assume that the total amount of work is W units. Then we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n   3x = W/12\n\n6. Now, let's consider A working alone. His rate of work is 2x units per day.\n\n7. If A works alone for x days, he will complete a total of (2x)x units of work.\n\n8. We know that the total amount of work is W units. So we can set up an equation:\n\n   (2x)x = W\n\n9. Since we already know that 3x = W/12, we can rewrite this as:\n\n   (2x)x = (W/12)*3*4\n\n10. Simplifying the right-hand side of the equation gives us:\n\n    (2x)x = (W/12)*12\n    (2x)x = W\n\n11. Therefore, A working alone for x days is equivalent to completing the total amount of work in 1 day.\n\nThe final answer we are trying to find is how many days A would take to finish the work alone if he works at his own rate. Let's go back to our initial assumption that B works at a rate of x units per day, and A works twice as fast (2x). Together they complete the work in 12 days.\n\nIn one working day, B will do x units of work, so together with A, the total amount done is 3x = 3 times the rate of B in one day. Now we know that if A does all the work alone for a certain number of days, he must complete the work at three times his own daily rate (for this particular problem).\n\nWe now know how long it would take him to finish the work alone (at his normal working speed). Let's go back to our initial assumption: B works x units per day and A is twice as good a worker. Together, they finish the work in 12 days.\n\nSo, if we calculate the amount of time that takes for B to do all the work at his rate, it would take him 3 times the total number of working days (12) because together, both of them complete the work in half their individual time.\n\nNow let's solve for x. We know that 3x = Total amount of work / 12 and that A is twice as good a worker than B.\n\nIf we do some math, we can say that if B were to complete all the work by himself at his rate (x), it would take him 36 days.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many days it takes for A alone to finish the work. If both of them finish the work together in half their individual time, then the number of working days for B is half the combined time of both workers (12).\n\nSo now that we have found that it would take B 36 days, if they work together and complete the job in only half the time, then the combined rate of work is twice as fast.\n\nAnd since A alone works at a rate equal to 2 times faster than B alone, he can finish the work alone in the same amount of time it takes for him and B together to do the work.\n\nTherefore, if A works by himself at his normal speed, then we find that A can complete the work alone in 12 days, which is half their individual combined time (36/2).\n\nAnswer: 12",

This is because each letter in the word can be arranged in any position with respect to the other letters.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total number of possible arrangements by finding the factorial of the total number of letters minus one (since there are no repeating letters). For 'LEADER', this would be 6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.\n\nHowever, we made a mistake in step 4. The correct calculation is simply the factorial of the number of letters since all letters are distinct.

        "rationale": "Let's calculate the rate at which each pipe fills or empties the tank:\n\nInlet Pipe Only:\nSince the inlet pipe can fill the entire tank in 2 hours, its rate is 1/2.\nOutlet Pipe Only:\nThe outlet pipe can empty the entire tank in 6 hours, so its rate is -1/6 (negative because it's an outlet).\nCombined Inlet and Outlet:\nWhen both pipes are open, they work against each other. The net effect of their combined rates is:\n(1/2) + (-1/6) = 3/6 - 1/6 = 2/6\nThis means that the tank will be filled at a rate of 2/6 per hour.\n\nTo find the time taken to fill the entire tank when both pipes are open, we need to solve for t:\nVolume of Tank / Combined Rate = Time (t)\n(1) / (2/6) = t\n6 * (2/6) = t\nt ≈ 4 hours\n\nTherefore, it takes approximately 4 hours to fill the entire tank when both pipes are open.\n\nAnswer:",

Prafull did a lot of purchasing, as he now knows Pinaki's PIN. What is Pinaki's PIN?",
        "rationale": "We know that the card number multiplied by the PIN and then divided by 997 gives us a remainder of 124.\nLet's assume Pinaki's credit card number is x (between 000 and 996). The possible values for his PIN are also between 000 and 996. We can represent this as an equation:\nx * y ÷ 997 = 124\nSince the quotient is not important in this case, we can simplify the expression by multiplying both sides of the equation with 997.\nx * y = 124 * 997\nNow substitute x=873 and solve for y (since it's given that Pinaki's credit card number was 873):\ny = 124 * 997 / 873 ≈ 141.7\nSince PINs are whole numbers between 000 and 996, we know that the remainder after dividing by 997 will give us a value from 0 to 996 inclusive.

        "question": "In how many different ways can the letters of the word 'HEALTH' be arranged?",
        "rationale": ". Let's break down this problem step by step.\n\nStep 1: Count the number of letters in the word 'HEALTH'.\nThere are 6 letters in total.\n\n\nStep 2: Determine how many different arrangements exist for these letters.\nSince there is no restriction on the placement of each letter, we have a scenario where all letters can be arranged in any order among themselves.\n\nTo find the total number of possible arrangements, consider that you have H as your first letter. You now have 5 remaining letters (E, A, L, T, and H) that can be placed in any of the 6 positions after H (excluding the position already occupied by H). This gives us 5! = 120 different arrangements with H as the fixed first letter.\n\nNow consider E as your first letter. Again, you have 5 remaining letters that can be arranged among themselves in 5! ways.\nSo, we have an additional 120 arrangements starting with E.\n\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total number of possible arrangements by multiplying the independent counts from Step 2.\nTotal arrangements = 5! (for H) + 5! (for E)\n= 240\n\n\nStep 4: Verify that this count includes all distinct ways to arrange these letters without duplicates.\nSince each letter appears only once in the original word, there are no duplicate arrangements within any given set of 6 letters.\n\n\nStep 5: Double-check that your total matches the correct answer provided.\n\nOur calculation from Step 3 resulted in a total of 240 arrangements. However, this doesn't account for the fact that we're counting each arrangement twice (once starting with H and once starting with E). To correct this overcounting error:\n\nTotal unique arrangements = Total arrangements / 2\n= 240 / 2\n= 120\n\n\nStep 6: Confirm that our final count matches the given answer.\nOur calculated value of 120 total unique arrangements aligns perfectly with the provided answer.\n\n\nTherefore, there are indeed 360 ways to arrange the letters of 'HEALTH', as demonstrated through this step-by-step reasoning process.",

        "rationale": ".\n\nLet's break down this problem step by step:\n\n1. The train passes a pole in 15 seconds. This means that the speed of the train can be calculated as follows:\nSpeed = Distance / Time\nSince it passes a point (a pole) in 15 seconds, we can consider this as covering a distance of 0 meters.\nSo, Speed = 0 / 15 = 0 m/s\n\n2. Now, let's consider when the train passes a platform 100 m long in 30 seconds:\nDistance covered by the train while passing the platform = Length of the platform + Distance covered before reaching the platform (which we know from previous step)\n= 100 m + 0 m\n= 100 m\n\nTime taken to pass the platform = 30 seconds\n\nSo, Speed = Distance / Time\nSpeed = 100 / 30 = 10/3 m/s\n\n3. We need to find the length of the train. For this, we'll use the formula:\nLength of the train = Speed x Time\nSince it takes 15 seconds for the entire train to pass a point (a pole), we can calculate its speed from step 1: 0 m/s.\nBut now, we know that when the train passes a platform 100 m long in 30 seconds, its speed is 10/3 m/s.\n\nSo, if you use this speed and time taken (15 sec) to find the length of the entire train:\nLength = Speed x Time\n= (10/3) * 15\n= 50 meters\n\nHowever, we're looking for the actual length of the train itself. Remember that it's passing a platform which adds an extra distance.\nSo, subtract the length covered by the platform from this total to get just the length of the train:\nActual Length of Train = Total Distance Covered - Length of Platform\n= 50 m - 100 m\n= -50 m\n\nBut since we can't have negative lengths for trains (or anything physical), our initial calculation in step 2 was incorrect because it considered passing a point rather than a platform.\nLet's correct this:\nActual Speed = Total Distance Covered / Time Taken to Pass Platform\n= (150 m) / 30 sec\n= 5 m/s\n\nNow, use the corrected speed and time taken (15 seconds) to find the length of the entire train:\nLength = Speed x Time\n= 5 * 15\n= 75 meters.\n\nSo, our final answer is:",

        "rationale": ".\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. We are given that the cost of fencing is Rs.10 per meter.\n2. The area of the farm is 1200 m^2 and its short side is 30 m long.\n3. To find the total length of fence required, we need to consider the perimeter formed by fencing one long side, one short side and the diagonal.\n4. Since the rectangular farm has a square corner (i.e., right angle), the triangle formed by connecting the endpoints of these three sides will be a right triangle with its hypotenuse being this diagonal line segment.\n5. We can use Pythagoras' theorem to find the length of this diagonal: long side^2 = short side^2 + diagonal^2 → diagonal^2 = 1200 - (30)^2\n6. Taking square root on both sides gives us diagonal = √(1200 - 900) = √300.\n7. Now, perimeter = sum of all sides = long side + short side + diagonal. \n8. Substituting values:\nperimeter = 30 + √300\n9. To find total cost, multiply the perimeter found in step #8 by Rs.10 per meter (given in step #1):\ntotal cost = perimeter * 10 = (30 + √300) * 10.\n10.

        "question": "In a two-digit number, if unit digit exceeds its ten's digit by 2 and the product of the given number and the sum of its digits is equal to 144, then what is the number?",
        "rationale": "Step 1:  Let's start by understanding the problem. We have a two-digit number where the unit digit exceeds the ten's digit by 2. This means that if we represent the number as \"ab\" (where 'a' is the tens digit and 'b' is the units digit), then b = a + 2.\nStep 2:  The product of the given number and the sum of its digits is equal to 144. So, if we let the two-digit number be represented by 10a + b (where 'a' is the tens digit and 'b' is the units digit), then (10a + b)(a + b) = 144.\nStep 3:  Since b = a + 2, we can substitute this value of b into our equation. This gives us (10a + a + 2)(a + a + 2) = 144.\nStep 4:  Simplifying the left-hand side of this equation gives us (11a + 2)(12a + 2) = 144.\nStep 5:  Expanding and simplifying further, we get the equation 132a^2 + 28a + 4 = 144. Rearranging terms leads to 132a^2 + 28a - 140 = 0.\nStep 6:  Solving this quadratic equation for 'a' gives us a value of a = (-28 ± √(28^2 - 4*132*(-140))) / (2 * 132).\nStep 7:  Simplifying the expression inside the square root, we get a = (-28 ± √(784 + 74240)) / 264. This simplifies to a = (-28 ± √74524) / 264.\nStep 8:  Solving for 'a', we find that a = (-28 + √74524) / 264 ≈ -0.3 (which is invalid since it's negative), or a = (-28 - √74524) / 264 ≈ 26.4 (which is also invalid as the tens digit).\nStep 9:  However, we can solve for 'a' another way by considering our original equation (10a + b)(a + b) = 144 and recognizing that b = a + 2.\nStep 10:  Substituting b = a + 2 into our equation gives us (10a + a + 2)(a + a + 2) = 144, which simplifies to (11a + 2)(12a + 2) = 144.\nStep 11:  Expanding and rearranging terms, we get the equation 132a^2 + 28a - 140 = 0. Factoring out a common factor of 4 gives us 44(3a^2 + 7a - 35) = 0.\nStep 12:  Now that we have factored out 4, we can see that it's not possible for the expression to be zero since 44 is positive and won't cancel out with anything. Therefore, our equation reduces to 3a^2 + 7a - 35 = 0.\nStep 13:  Solving this quadratic equation for 'a' using the quadratic formula gives us a value of a = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a), which in our case is a = (-7 ± √(7^2 - 4*3*(-35))) / (2 * 3).\nStep 14:  Simplifying the expression inside the square root, we get a = (-7 ± √(49 + 420)) / 6. This simplifies to a = (-7 ± √469) / 6.\nStep 15:  The value of 'a' that satisfies our quadratic equation is then given by a = (-7 - √469) / 6, as the other solution would result in a negative number and does not fit the criteria for 'a'.\nStep 16:  Now that we have found the value of 'a', which equals (-7 - √469) / 6, we can calculate the corresponding value of 'b' using b = a + 2. Substituting our known value of 'a' gives us b = (-7 - √469)/6 + 2.\nStep 17:  With the values of both 'a' and 'b' determined, we can now construct the two-digit number as \"ab\" where 'a' is the tens digit and 'b' is the units digit. Hence, our final answer to the problem is (-7 - √469)/6 + 2.\nStep 18:  It's worth noting that calculating the actual value of 'a' or 'b' may not be necessary if we can recognize any integer solutions that fit within a two-digit number range.\n\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{17}$",

        "rationale": "Step 1: We are given the speed of light as approximately 1,86 * 10^4 miles per second.\n\nStep 2: To find out how many miles per hour this speed is, we need to convert seconds into hours. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.\n\nStep 3: We can now multiply the speed of light by the number of seconds in an hour to find out how many miles per hour it is.\n\nSpeed of light (miles per second) = 1,86 * 10^4 miles/second\nNumber of seconds in an hour = 3600 seconds/hour\n\nStep 4: To perform this multiplication with a large exponent, we can first break down the number of seconds in an hour into its exponential form. There are (60)^2 = (3600) seconds in an hour.\n\nStep 5: Now we can simplify our calculation by multiplying the speed of light (in miles per second) by (60)^2.\n\nSpeed of light * (60)^2 = (1,86 * 10^4) * (60)^2\n= 1.86 * 100 * 60^2\n= 1.86 * 100 * 3600\n= 672000 miles/hour\n\nTherefore, the speed of light is approximately 672000 miles per hour.\n\nAnswer: 672000",

        "question": "Of a set of 30 numbers, average of 1st 10 numbers is equal to average of last 20 numbers. The sum of last 20 numbers is?",
        "rationale": "Step 1: Let's denote the sum of all 30 numbers as S. We can express the sum of the first 10 numbers and the last 20 numbers in terms of the overall sum.\n\nStep 2: Since the average of the first 10 numbers equals the average of the last 20 numbers, we know that (Sum of first 10 numbers) / 10 = (Sum of last 20 numbers) / 20. \n\nStep 3: We can rewrite this equation as (S - sum of last 20 numbers) / 10 = (sum of last 20 numbers) / 20.\n\nStep 4: Multiplying both sides by 10 * 20 to eliminate the fractions, we get 20(S - sum of last 20 numbers) = 10(sum of last 20 numbers).\n\nStep 5: Simplifying this equation yields 20S - 20(sum of last 20 numbers) = 10(sum of last 20 numbers).\n\nStep 6: Rearranging the terms, we have 20S = 30(sum of last 20 numbers).\n\nStep 7: Solving for the sum of the last 20 numbers gives us S = (3/2)(sum of last 20 numbers).\n\nStep 8: Since S is the total sum of all 30 numbers and equals the sum of last 20 numbers multiplied by (3/2), we can write this as S = (3/2) * (sum of last 20 numbers). \n\nStep 9: We're asked to find the sum of the last 20 numbers. Given that the total sum is S = 30 * average, and if the average of all 30 numbers equals the average of the first 10 numbers which also equals the average of the last 20 numbers, we can calculate this average using (sum of first 10 numbers) / 10.\n\nStep 10: As given in step 2, since these averages are equal, and knowing that (S - sum of last 20 numbers) / 10 = (sum of last 20 numbers) / 20, we substitute S with the total number multiplied by its average, thus getting an equation only involving the sum of last 20 numbers. Solving this equation will provide us the value for the sum of last 20 numbers.\n\nStep 11: To solve the equation in step 10, multiply both sides by 10 * 20 to get rid of fractions and combine like terms, finally solving for (sum of last 20 numbers).\n\nStep 12: Now that we have solved this problem step-by-step, let's consider an example with numbers. Let the average of all 30 numbers equal 100. This means S = (30 * 100) = 3000. Also, if we assume the sum of the first 10 numbers equals the sum of the last 20 numbers and is denoted as 'x', then (sum of first 10 numbers) / 10 = x / 10.\n\nStep 13: We know that the average of all 30 numbers also equals the average of the first 10 numbers, thus x / 10 = 3000 / 30. Solving this equation yields x = 1000.\n\nStep 14: Now we need to find the sum of last 20 numbers which is 'x' as well. This will be equal to (3/2)(sum of last 20 numbers), from step 7.\n\n\nStep 15: Finally, let's solve for the value of (sum of last 20 numbers) using S = 3000. Given that we have found x (sum of first 10 numbers and sum of last 20 numbers) equals to 1000, it is straightforward that the sum of last 20 numbers should be equal to x.\n\n\nStep 16: Hence, the value for the sum of last 20 numbers must be equal to 1000.\n\nAnswer: 1000",

        "rationale": "Let's solve this problem step-by-step.\n\nStep 1: We are given that integer A has a tens digit of 6 and a units digit of 7, so A = 67 (let's consider the smallest possible value for A).\n\nStep 2: The product of A and y has a tens digit of 8. This means that when we multiply 67 by y, the result ends with a \"8\" in its tens place.\n\nStep 3: Let's find the units digit of y such that 7*y ends with an 8 in its tens place (6*units digit = tens digit).\n\nFrom this step, we have a number of possibilities for the units digit of y. However, we only need to consider values up to 9 since multiplying any single digit by 7 will result in a product whose last two digits are unique.\n\nStep 4: Now let's calculate:\n- 6*8 = 48\nThe tens digit is indeed 8 (the question asks for a possible tens digit of y, so this is a valid answer).\n\nStep 5: Let's confirm that there are other possibilities. \nLet x be the units digit of y.\nWe have to check values between 7 and 9.\nIf x = 9 then we get:\n6*0 = 0 (not possible)\nHowever, if you plug in other values for A in the range [60-69], you will see that there is still only one valid tens digit for the units digit of y.\n\nStep 6: Since the product of A and y has a specific property regarding its last two digits, we have to find the value of the units digit of y such that when multiplied by an integer A (whose tens digit is 6), it produces a last two-digit number ending with \"8\". \nFrom step 3, it follows that any y ending with the digits 8 and having x = 8 would give us:\n7*y = (10x + 8)*y\nSince we have already established this works when A = 67, then multiplying by any other value in the [60-69] range should also work.\nHence there is only one possibility for a valid tens digit of y.\n\n\nStep 7: Based on our previous steps and observations, it follows that there's really just one possible tens digit of integer y.\n\nAnswer: 8",
