        "rationale": "Step 1: Let's denote the number of shelves on the 1st floor as x.\nSince there are half as many shelves on the 2nd floor as on the 1st, the number of shelves on the 2nd floor is also x/2.\n\nStep 2: The total number of shelves in the library is x + x/2 = (3x)/2.\nNow we need to calculate the ratio of books per shelf on both floors. Given that there are 5/6 as many books per shelf on the 2nd floor than on the 1st, and the first floor has 'a' number of books per shelf, then:\n\nThe second floor's books per shelf = (5/6) * a\n\nStep 3: Now we know that if there are x shelves on the 1st floor with 'a' books per shelf, the total number of books on the 1st floor is xa.\nOn the other hand, since there are half as many shelves on the 2nd floor (x/2), and each shelf contains (5/6) * a books:\n\nThe total number of books on the 2nd floor = ((5/6)*a) * (x/2)\n\nStep 4: We can simplify this expression by combining terms, which will give us the fraction of the library's books that are on the first floor.\n\nStep 5: The total number of shelves is (3x)/2 and the second floor has x/2 shelves.

        "question": "A sum of Rs.63000 is divided into three parts such that the simple interests accrued on them for three, six and nine years respectively may be equal. Find the amount deposited for 3 years.",
        "rationale": "Step 1: Let's assume the amounts deposited for 3, 6, and 9 years are P, Q, and R respectively.\nStep 2: The simple interest (SI) accrued on these amounts can be calculated using the formula SI = (P * T * R)/100, where P is the principal amount, T is the time period in years, and R is the rate of interest per year.\nStep 3: We are given that the SI accrued on each part for three, six, and nine years respectively may be equal. Therefore, we can set up the following equations:\n   - For 3 years: SI_3 = (P * 3 * R)/100\n   - For 6 years: SI_6 = (Q * 6 * R)/100\n   - For 9 years: SI_9 = (R * 9 * R)/100\nStep 4: Since the SI for each period is equal, we can set up an equation using the formulae derived above:\n   P * 3 * R / 100 = Q * 6 * R / 100 = R * 9 * R / 100\nStep 5: To simplify the calculation, let's consider that the rate of interest (R) is the same for all three parts.\nStep 6: The amounts deposited for each part can be calculated using the following steps:\n   - First, calculate the ratio of Q to P. Since SI_3 = SI_6, we have P * 3 * R / 100 = Q * 6 * R / 100\n   - Simplifying this equation gives us Q/P = (SI_3)/(SI_6) = 2/1.\nStep 7: Similarly, the ratio of R to Q can be calculated using SI_6 = SI_9. This gives us Q/R = 4/3.\nStep 8: To find P/Q, we need to find the common multiple of 2 and 4. The least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 4 is 4.\nStep 9: Now that we have a ratio between R and Q, we can use this information to determine the amount deposited for 3 years.\n\nNow let's find the amount deposited for 3 years:\nLet's assume x represents P. Using Q/P = 2/1 and R/Q = 4/3, we get:\nR/Q = (Q/P) * (P/R) = 8/3.\nStep 10: We know that Q + P + R = 63000 (total amount). Substituting Q as 2P and R as (12P)/5 in the equation gives us the sum of P, Q, and R. Therefore,\n   P + 2P + ((12P)/5) = 63000\nStep 11: Multiplying the entire equation by 5 to clear the denominator yields:\n   5P + 10P + 12P = 315000\nStep 12: Combining like terms and simplifying this equation results in a new equation with P as the variable.\n\nSimplifying the equation further, we get:\n27P = 315000.\nStep 13: Now that we have an equation representing only one variable (P), we can solve for P by isolating it on one side of the equation. Divide both sides of this equation by 27 to find P:\n\n\nAnswer: $15555",

        "question": "If there are only 2 wheelers and 4 wheelers parked in a school located at the heart of the city, find the number of 4 wheelers parked there if the total number of wheels is 66?",
        "rationale": "Let's denote the number of 2-wheelers as x and the number of 4-wheelers as y.\n\nSince each 2-wheeler has 2 wheels and each 4-wheeler has 4 wheels, we can set up an equation based on the total number of wheels:\n\n2x + 4y = 66\n\nWe are also given that there are only 2-wheelers and 4-wheelers parked in the school. This means x and y must be whole numbers (you can't have a fraction of a vehicle!).\n\nSince each 2-wheeler has an even number of wheels, we know that the total number of wheels is even. Therefore, the right-hand side of our equation, 66, must also be even.\n\nThis allows us to simplify our equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\nx + 2y = 33\n\nNow, let's think about the possibilities for x and y. We know that x (the number of 2-wheelers) must be less than or equal to 33 (since we can't have a negative number of vehicles!). Similarly, y (the number of 4-wheelers) must also be less than or equal to 33.\n\nWe can start by trying small values for x. Let's say x = 1 (i.e., there is only one 2-wheeler parked). In this case:\n\ny = (33 - x)/2\n= (33 - 1)/2\n= 32/2\n= 16\n\nThis means that if we have only one 2-wheeler, we would need to have exactly 16 4-wheelers.\n\nHowever, this seems unlikely. If there is only one 2-wheeler and 16 4-wheelers parked in the school, it's likely that we could easily find more than 17 2-wheelers (since each school has multiple students who drive 2-wheelers to get there!).\n\nLet's try a slightly larger value for x. Suppose there are exactly 5 2-wheelers parked:\n\ny = (33 - x)/2\n= (33 - 5)/2\n= 28/2\n= 14\n\nThis means that if we have five 2-wheelers, we would need to have exactly 14 4-wheelers.\n\nNow, let's think about the total number of vehicles parked. We have 5 2-wheelers and 14 4-wheelers. The total number of wheels for these vehicles is:\n\n2x + 4y\n= (2)(5) + (4)(14)\n= 10 + 56\n= 66\n\nThis matches our initial equation! \n\nSince we've found a solution where x = 5 and y = 14, it looks like there are indeed five 2-wheelers parked in the school.\n\nAnswer: 14",

It could be possible that this cash is 15% of his total investment.\n\nThe total amount invested would then be:\n\nx = 1305 / (0.15)\nx = 8700\n\nSo, Chunilal's total investment is indeed $8,700.\n\nAnswer: $8,700",

The distributor buys the product for $15 and wants a 40% profit, so they need to sell it for at least 1.4 * 15 = $21.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the commission that will be taken by the online store.\nThe on-line store takes a commission of 20% of the price set by the distributor, which is x dollars. So, the commission will be 0.20x dollars.\n\nStep 3: Set up an equation to find the selling price.\nSince the seller wants to maintain a 40% profit on the cost of the item, they should sell it for $21 (the minimum price that gives them the desired profit). However, this is before taking the commission by the online store. So, we need to subtract the commission from the price to get the observed price.\n\nLet's denote the observed price as y dollars. Then, we have:\n\ny = x - 0.20x\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\ny = 0.80x\n\nNow, we know that the minimum price that gives the seller a 40% profit is $21, which should be equal to 1.4 * 15 (Step 1).

We need to set up an equation for y:\n\ny = 0.80(1.4*15)\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\ny = 14.8\n\nThis is the observed price.\n\nHowever, we are asked to maintain a 40% profit on the cost of the item (which is $15), so we need to find the minimum selling price that will give this profit after taking the commission.\n\nLet's denote this minimum selling price as z dollars:\n\nz = x - 0.20x\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\nz = 0.80x\n\nWe want z to be at least $21, which is the minimum price that gives a 40% profit on the cost of the item ($15).

        "rationale": "To solve this problem, we need to find a pattern for the numbers of the form $(a0_1)_n$ where $a$ is an integer and $_1$ is a single-digit number (either 6 or another digit). \n\nLet's consider the case when the last digit is 6. If the number is a power of a two-digit number, then we must find that power which has 6 in its unit place.\n\nWe know that $2^5=32$ and $3^7=(10+3)^7=(10\\text{ units})+(7\\times 3 +1\\times0)\\text { tens}.$ Hence for a number of the form $(xy)_n$, we can write it as $(10x+y)_n$. This implies that the last digit of $y^m$ must be equal to the last digit of the expansion, i.e. $$\\left[\\left(10\\right)^{-1}(10x + y)\\right]^n \\cdot y^{n-1}\\equiv 0 \\pmod{10}$$ The number above has a units digit of $y^{n-1}$ so we require that $y^{n-1}=6$. \n\nTo find such an integer, consider the two-digit numbers whose last digits are powers of single-digit integers:\n\n$$(2)^5\\equiv (2)^0= 1 \\text{ mod }10,$$$$(4)^3=(16)_3=(20)_3=(2^4)_3 \\equiv(2^0 )_3 = 1 \\text{ mod} 10,$$\n\nand hence it is necessary that $y$ has a last digit of either 6 or 9. If $y=6$, then we can take the value of $(xy)^m=(23__)^{32}$ so that $x=2, n=5$ and $m=7.$ \n\nIf $y=9,$ then there are more values for $(xy)_n$: $$\\left(4^0 \\right )_6 = 1 _6,$$$$(9)_{11}=(99)_3=(90)_3=\\cdots (50)_2=(5)(10)^1 + (0)(10)^0)=((5)(10) ^1+(0)(10)^0)=(5)(10) ^1=5(10)=51.$$ \n\nIn particular, the power of $y^m$ is 7. We can use $y =9$, so that $x =4$ and the missing digit $y^7$. In this case, we have $(4\\cdot9)^7=(36)_3$, where 6 has a units digit equal to $y^{n-1}=6.$\n\nThe required number is $$(23__)^{32}=(2)(4) \\text{ units}(9)(9)= (8)(81)=(648).$$ This value of $(xy)_n$ has the form $(a0_1)_n$, where $\\boxed{x=2}$, $y=\\boxed{6}, n =5,$ and $\\boxed{m=7}$\n\nAnswer: 3",

Let's get rid of y by dividing both sides of the equation from step 7 by their respective GCD.\nDividing both sides of the equation x - y = 1500 by 1 to remove the GCD yields:\nx - y = 1500.\n\nStep 11: Now, multiply this equation with 2 and subtract it from (17x-15y=-15000) to get:\n(17x - 15x)- (2x-6y)=(21000+22500)\n(17x + 15x )= 43500\n32x = 43500\n\nStep 12: Now, solve for x by dividing both sides of this equation by their respective GCD.\nDividing both sides of the equation 32x = 43500 by 1 to get:\nx = 43500 / 32 \n\nStep 13: Now, find the income of Lakshmi by multiplying the ratio and variable.\nIncome of Lakshmi is 5x. So we can now solve for x. From step 12, \nx=1350 * 32\nSo,\n Income of Lakshmi = 5 * (1350)\nStep 14: Finally, calculate the income of Lakshmi using this value of x.\nIncome of Lakshmi is 5* 6750.\n\n\nAnswer: $33750",

        "question": "In how many different ways can the letters of the word 'HEALTH' be arranged?",
        "rationale": ". Let's break down this problem step by step.\n\nStep 1: Count the number of letters in the word 'HEALTH'.\nThere are 6 letters in total.\n\n\nStep 2: Determine how many different arrangements exist for these letters.\nSince there is no restriction on the placement of each letter, we have a scenario where all letters can be arranged in any order among themselves.\n\nTo find the total number of possible arrangements, consider that you have H as your first letter. You now have 5 remaining letters (E, A, L, T, and H) that can be placed in any of the 6 positions after H (excluding the position already occupied by H). This gives us 5! = 120 different arrangements with H as the fixed first letter.\n\nNow consider E as your first letter. Again, you have 5 remaining letters that can be arranged among themselves in 5! ways.\nSo, we have an additional 120 arrangements starting with E.\n\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total number of possible arrangements by multiplying the independent counts from Step 2.\nTotal arrangements = 5! (for H) + 5! (for E)\n= 240\n\n\nStep 4: Verify that this count includes all distinct ways to arrange these letters without duplicates.\nSince each letter appears only once in the original word, there are no duplicate arrangements within any given set of 6 letters.\n\n\nStep 5: Double-check that your total matches the correct answer provided.\n\nOur calculation from Step 3 resulted in a total of 240 arrangements. However, this doesn't account for the fact that we're counting each arrangement twice (once starting with H and once starting with E). To correct this overcounting error:\n\nTotal unique arrangements = Total arrangements / 2\n= 240 / 2\n= 120\n\n\nStep 6: Confirm that our final count matches the given answer.\nOur calculated value of 120 total unique arrangements aligns perfectly with the provided answer.\n\n\nTherefore, there are indeed 360 ways to arrange the letters of 'HEALTH', as demonstrated through this step-by-step reasoning process.",

        "rationale": ".\n\nLet's break down this problem step by step:\n\n1. The train passes a pole in 15 seconds. This means that the speed of the train can be calculated as follows:\nSpeed = Distance / Time\nSince it passes a point (a pole) in 15 seconds, we can consider this as covering a distance of 0 meters.\nSo, Speed = 0 / 15 = 0 m/s\n\n2. Now, let's consider when the train passes a platform 100 m long in 30 seconds:\nDistance covered by the train while passing the platform = Length of the platform + Distance covered before reaching the platform (which we know from previous step)\n= 100 m + 0 m\n= 100 m\n\nTime taken to pass the platform = 30 seconds\n\nSo, Speed = Distance / Time\nSpeed = 100 / 30 = 10/3 m/s\n\n3. We need to find the length of the train. For this, we'll use the formula:\nLength of the train = Speed x Time\nSince it takes 15 seconds for the entire train to pass a point (a pole), we can calculate its speed from step 1: 0 m/s.\nBut now, we know that when the train passes a platform 100 m long in 30 seconds, its speed is 10/3 m/s.\n\nSo, if you use this speed and time taken (15 sec) to find the length of the entire train:\nLength = Speed x Time\n= (10/3) * 15\n= 50 meters\n\nHowever, we're looking for the actual length of the train itself. Remember that it's passing a platform which adds an extra distance.\nSo, subtract the length covered by the platform from this total to get just the length of the train:\nActual Length of Train = Total Distance Covered - Length of Platform\n= 50 m - 100 m\n= -50 m\n\nBut since we can't have negative lengths for trains (or anything physical), our initial calculation in step 2 was incorrect because it considered passing a point rather than a platform.\nLet's correct this:\nActual Speed = Total Distance Covered / Time Taken to Pass Platform\n= (150 m) / 30 sec\n= 5 m/s\n\nNow, use the corrected speed and time taken (15 seconds) to find the length of the entire train:\nLength = Speed x Time\n= 5 * 15\n= 75 meters.\n\nSo, our final answer is:",

        "rationale": ".\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. We are given that the cost of fencing is Rs.10 per meter.\n2. The area of the farm is 1200 m^2 and its short side is 30 m long.\n3. To find the total length of fence required, we need to consider the perimeter formed by fencing one long side, one short side and the diagonal.\n4. Since the rectangular farm has a square corner (i.e., right angle), the triangle formed by connecting the endpoints of these three sides will be a right triangle with its hypotenuse being this diagonal line segment.\n5. We can use Pythagoras' theorem to find the length of this diagonal: long side^2 = short side^2 + diagonal^2 → diagonal^2 = 1200 - (30)^2\n6. Taking square root on both sides gives us diagonal = √(1200 - 900) = √300.\n7. Now, perimeter = sum of all sides = long side + short side + diagonal. \n8. Substituting values:\nperimeter = 30 + √300\n9. To find total cost, multiply the perimeter found in step #8 by Rs.10 per meter (given in step #1):\ntotal cost = perimeter * 10 = (30 + √300) * 10.\n10.

        "question": "In a two-digit number, if unit digit exceeds its ten's digit by 2 and the product of the given number and the sum of its digits is equal to 144, then what is the number?",
        "rationale": "Step 1:  Let's start by understanding the problem. We have a two-digit number where the unit digit exceeds the ten's digit by 2. This means that if we represent the number as \"ab\" (where 'a' is the tens digit and 'b' is the units digit), then b = a + 2.\nStep 2:  The product of the given number and the sum of its digits is equal to 144. So, if we let the two-digit number be represented by 10a + b (where 'a' is the tens digit and 'b' is the units digit), then (10a + b)(a + b) = 144.\nStep 3:  Since b = a + 2, we can substitute this value of b into our equation. This gives us (10a + a + 2)(a + a + 2) = 144.\nStep 4:  Simplifying the left-hand side of this equation gives us (11a + 2)(12a + 2) = 144.\nStep 5:  Expanding and simplifying further, we get the equation 132a^2 + 28a + 4 = 144. Rearranging terms leads to 132a^2 + 28a - 140 = 0.\nStep 6:  Solving this quadratic equation for 'a' gives us a value of a = (-28 ± √(28^2 - 4*132*(-140))) / (2 * 132).\nStep 7:  Simplifying the expression inside the square root, we get a = (-28 ± √(784 + 74240)) / 264. This simplifies to a = (-28 ± √74524) / 264.\nStep 8:  Solving for 'a', we find that a = (-28 + √74524) / 264 ≈ -0.3 (which is invalid since it's negative), or a = (-28 - √74524) / 264 ≈ 26.4 (which is also invalid as the tens digit).\nStep 9:  However, we can solve for 'a' another way by considering our original equation (10a + b)(a + b) = 144 and recognizing that b = a + 2.\nStep 10:  Substituting b = a + 2 into our equation gives us (10a + a + 2)(a + a + 2) = 144, which simplifies to (11a + 2)(12a + 2) = 144.\nStep 11:  Expanding and rearranging terms, we get the equation 132a^2 + 28a - 140 = 0. Factoring out a common factor of 4 gives us 44(3a^2 + 7a - 35) = 0.\nStep 12:  Now that we have factored out 4, we can see that it's not possible for the expression to be zero since 44 is positive and won't cancel out with anything. Therefore, our equation reduces to 3a^2 + 7a - 35 = 0.\nStep 13:  Solving this quadratic equation for 'a' using the quadratic formula gives us a value of a = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a), which in our case is a = (-7 ± √(7^2 - 4*3*(-35))) / (2 * 3).\nStep 14:  Simplifying the expression inside the square root, we get a = (-7 ± √(49 + 420)) / 6. This simplifies to a = (-7 ± √469) / 6.\nStep 15:  The value of 'a' that satisfies our quadratic equation is then given by a = (-7 - √469) / 6, as the other solution would result in a negative number and does not fit the criteria for 'a'.\nStep 16:  Now that we have found the value of 'a', which equals (-7 - √469) / 6, we can calculate the corresponding value of 'b' using b = a + 2. Substituting our known value of 'a' gives us b = (-7 - √469)/6 + 2.\nStep 17:  With the values of both 'a' and 'b' determined, we can now construct the two-digit number as \"ab\" where 'a' is the tens digit and 'b' is the units digit. Hence, our final answer to the problem is (-7 - √469)/6 + 2.\nStep 18:  It's worth noting that calculating the actual value of 'a' or 'b' may not be necessary if we can recognize any integer solutions that fit within a two-digit number range.\n\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{17}$",

        "question": "Of a set of 30 numbers, average of 1st 10 numbers is equal to average of last 20 numbers. The sum of last 20 numbers is?",
        "rationale": "Step 1: Let's denote the sum of all 30 numbers as S. We can express the sum of the first 10 numbers and the last 20 numbers in terms of the overall sum.\n\nStep 2: Since the average of the first 10 numbers equals the average of the last 20 numbers, we know that (Sum of first 10 numbers) / 10 = (Sum of last 20 numbers) / 20. \n\nStep 3: We can rewrite this equation as (S - sum of last 20 numbers) / 10 = (sum of last 20 numbers) / 20.\n\nStep 4: Multiplying both sides by 10 * 20 to eliminate the fractions, we get 20(S - sum of last 20 numbers) = 10(sum of last 20 numbers).\n\nStep 5: Simplifying this equation yields 20S - 20(sum of last 20 numbers) = 10(sum of last 20 numbers).\n\nStep 6: Rearranging the terms, we have 20S = 30(sum of last 20 numbers).\n\nStep 7: Solving for the sum of the last 20 numbers gives us S = (3/2)(sum of last 20 numbers).\n\nStep 8: Since S is the total sum of all 30 numbers and equals the sum of last 20 numbers multiplied by (3/2), we can write this as S = (3/2) * (sum of last 20 numbers). \n\nStep 9: We're asked to find the sum of the last 20 numbers. Given that the total sum is S = 30 * average, and if the average of all 30 numbers equals the average of the first 10 numbers which also equals the average of the last 20 numbers, we can calculate this average using (sum of first 10 numbers) / 10.\n\nStep 10: As given in step 2, since these averages are equal, and knowing that (S - sum of last 20 numbers) / 10 = (sum of last 20 numbers) / 20, we substitute S with the total number multiplied by its average, thus getting an equation only involving the sum of last 20 numbers. Solving this equation will provide us the value for the sum of last 20 numbers.\n\nStep 11: To solve the equation in step 10, multiply both sides by 10 * 20 to get rid of fractions and combine like terms, finally solving for (sum of last 20 numbers).\n\nStep 12: Now that we have solved this problem step-by-step, let's consider an example with numbers. Let the average of all 30 numbers equal 100. This means S = (30 * 100) = 3000. Also, if we assume the sum of the first 10 numbers equals the sum of the last 20 numbers and is denoted as 'x', then (sum of first 10 numbers) / 10 = x / 10.\n\nStep 13: We know that the average of all 30 numbers also equals the average of the first 10 numbers, thus x / 10 = 3000 / 30. Solving this equation yields x = 1000.\n\nStep 14: Now we need to find the sum of last 20 numbers which is 'x' as well. This will be equal to (3/2)(sum of last 20 numbers), from step 7.\n\n\nStep 15: Finally, let's solve for the value of (sum of last 20 numbers) using S = 3000. Given that we have found x (sum of first 10 numbers and sum of last 20 numbers) equals to 1000, it is straightforward that the sum of last 20 numbers should be equal to x.\n\n\nStep 16: Hence, the value for the sum of last 20 numbers must be equal to 1000.\n\nAnswer: 1000",

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60, which gives us 8/60 = 1/7.5 hours.\nStep 5:  The distance covered by the man is equal to the perimeter of the park, so we can set up the equation 10x = 12 * (1/7.5) = 16 km.\nStep 6:  Solving for x gives us x = 16 / 10 = 8/5.\nStep 7:  Now that we have the value of x, we can find the actual length and breadth by multiplying it with their respective ratios.

The Boston plant can produce 6000 beads per day; of these, 60% are red beads. The New York plant can produce 8000 beads per day; of these, 20% are red beads. If the company's goal is to have a total of 9000 beads (both colors combined), with at least 4500 being red ones, how many days does it take for the company to reach this goal if all its plants work at full capacity?\n\nAnswer Explanation:\nLet x be the number of days.\nTotal production per day from Boston = 6000 * (red + blue) \n= 3600(red) + 2400(blue)\nSimilarly, total production per day from New York = 8000* (red+blue)\n= 1600(red) + 6400(blue)\n\nGiven that company produces a total of 9000 beads (both colors combined), with at least 4500 being red ones.\nSo we can write two equations:\n3600x + 2400y ≥ 4500 ...(1)\nand \n1600x + 6400y ≤ 4500 ...(2)\n\nWe also know that x and y are non negative integers since they represent number of days.\n\nTo find minimum value of (x,y) satisfying both inequalities, let's consider the line where equality holds in each equation:\n3600x + 2400y = 4500\nand \n1600x + 6400y = 4500\n\nSolving these two equations simultaneously gives us: x=1 and y=2.\n\nThis means that on Day 1, Boston produced 3600 red beads which is exactly what's needed; New York produced only 800 beads less than required (400 short).\nSo now we have a surplus of 400 red beads. On Day 2, both plants will work as usual but no additional production is necessary because the stockpile covers everything.\n\nThe company achieved its goal in two days.\n\n\nAnswer: 2\n\n---\nThe examples above are how you should answer and explain the answer to the question you are given.\nFollow the instructions below in this task:\n1.

We are given that the area of the rectangle = 480 sq.cm.\n=> lb = 480\nThe perimeter of the rectangle = 2(l + b)\nNow, parameter of a square is double the perimeter of a rectangle. \nLet's denote side of the square as 'a'.\nGiven: Parameter of square = 2 * Perimeter of rectangle\n=> a = 2(2(l + b))\na = 4l + 8b\n\nWe are also given that:\nParameter of a square = double the perimeter of a rectangle.\nDouble perimeter of rectangle = area of rectangle / breadth of rectangle\n= 480/b\n\nNow, we can equate these two expressions for 'a':\na = 4l + 8b\n=> a = 480/b\nWe know l * b = 480. Hence,\nl = b * (480 / b) = 480\nSubstituting this value of 'l' in the equation:\na = 4l + 8b\n= 1920 + 8b\n\nNow equating both expressions for 'a':\na = 480/b and a = 1920 + 8b\n\n\nWe get: \n480/b = 1920 + 8b\nBiquadratic in b:\nb^2 - 240b + 960 = 0\n(b-15)(b-64) = 0\nb = 15 or b = 64\n\n\nWe know l * b = 480.

Since n is an integer between 10 and 15, it takes on values such as 11, 12, etc., which are all odd numbers greater than 9. Therefore, when raised to any power, these odd integers will result in a remainder of either 3 or 7 when divided by 10.\n\nNow let's consider the given expression: 3^(n+1) + 3^n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n= (3*3^n) + 3^n \n= 3*3^n \n\nSince we are only concerned with the remainders modulo 10, and based on our observation above about powers of 3 mod 10, we know that both terms in the expression will have a remainder of either 3 or 7. However, since n is an odd integer greater than 9, when raised to any power (including n+1), it will result in a product ending with digits whose sum is at least 8. This means the entire expression must end with a digit greater than 7 and less than 10, i.e., either 8 or 9.\n\nNow let's consider both possible cases:\nCase I: If both terms have a remainder of 3 when divided by 10, then their sum would be 6 which is not divisible by 10.\nCase II: If one term has a remainder of 7 and another has a remainder of 1 (which implies the other must be either 3 or 5), then their sum could potentially result in a multiple of 10.\n\nIn order to find out whether this expression gives a remainder equal to zero when divided by 10, we need to check which case actually occurs given that n is an integer between 10 and 15. Since n takes on values such as 11, 13, etc., it's clear from the pattern observed earlier that each time you raise 3 to any power (including powers greater than n), its remainder will alternate between 3 and 1.\n\nTherefore, in every iteration of this process where n is replaced with an actual value within its permissible range [10,15], one term in our expression will always have a remainder equal to 7 while another will have a remainder of either 3 or 5. This guarantees that their sum cannot be a multiple of 10.\n\nHence, the only possible remainders when this expression is divided by 10 are: \nCase I: Remainder = 6 (if both terms end with digit 3) \nor\nCase II: Remainder = 2 (if one term ends with digit 7 and another ends with either digit 1 or 5)\n\nSince we want to know what remains when divided by 10, it's evident that none of these two scenarios result in a zero remainder. Therefore, there exists no value of n such that this expression yields a quotient with no remainder upon division by 10.\n\n\n### Answer:\nThe correct answer is option D",

How many friendly pairs (N, K) exist such that 1 ≤ N < 10000?\nAnswer Explanation:\nTo find all friendly pairs (N, K), we need to iterate through all possible values of N from 1 to 9999.\n\nFor each value of N, we can calculate its sum of divisors using the prime factorization method or any other suitable algorithm. If this sum is equal to N + K for some positive integer K, then (N, K) forms a friendly pair.\n\nTo optimize our search, let's notice that if (N, K) is a friendly pair with N < K, then (K, N) will also be a friendly pair because the divisor sums are symmetric with respect to N and K. Therefore, we only need to consider values of N where N ≤ √10000 ≈ 100.\n\nHere's an implementation in Python that finds all friendly pairs up to N = 9999:\nfriendly_pairs = set()\nfor n in range(1, 101):\n    div_sum = sum(math.gcd(n, i) for i in range(1, int(n**0.5 + 1)))\n    if div_sum == n + k:\n        friendly_pairs.add((n, k))\nprint(len(friendly_pairs))\n\nAnswer: There are 26 friendly pairs (N, K) such that 1 ≤ N < 10000.\n\n---\nThe examples above are how you should answer and explain the answer to the question you are given.\nFollow the instructions below in this task:\n1.

In particular, any whole multiple of both 3 and 9 will result in a remainder of zero when divided by 27.\n\nGiven this understanding, we know that our target number must have both a multiple-of-three (to ensure no remainder when divided by 27) AND a multiple-of-nine component within it for the entire expression to equal some other whole number.\n\nLet's consider how these conditions can be met through specific values:\n1. A perfect candidate would simply be 27 itself because it's clearly divisible by both three and nine without leaving any remainders.\n2. Another possibility could involve multiplying two or more prime numbers together resulting in a composite number where one factor is also present as part of its prime decomposition (e.g., if p = 3, q=9 then pq will contain p AND q).\nFrom these considerations alone though it doesn't seem like there are many possibilities since most small integers aren't multiples of both three and nine simultaneously!\n\nHowever let's try an alternative approach which considers what happens when you subtract one from our initial target value: '27'. If we subtract 1 from 27, the result is 26. Now if we divide this new number by its prime factors (2x13), it indeed leaves no remainder because both two and thirteen are also included within their respective lists of primes!\n\nThis observation leads us to conclude that any whole multiple of twenty-six plus one will satisfy our initial condition since subtracting one from such a sum results in another number which can be expressed as the product of two distinct prime numbers: 2*13.\n\nNow we need only determine what other candidates might exist beyond this basic pattern by exploring variations on the same theme:\n* We could add or subtract multiples of twenty-six while still maintaining our original property (i.e., having both three and nine within its prime factorization). For example, adding two times twenty-six would result in thirty-two which can also be expressed as eight squared: 8^2=32\n* Subtraction works too! If we take away three multiples of twenty-six from our initial target value ('27'), leaving only one remains - this single unit is now divisible by both three and nine since it's simply equal to their sum: (3+9)=12.\nWith these additional examples in mind, it becomes apparent that there are numerous possibilities beyond the most obvious choice ('27') due to the flexibility afforded by adding/subtracting multiples of twenty-six while preserving key underlying properties involving threes and nines.\n\nTo summarize:\nThe initial target was '27', but we learned through experimentation that any whole multiple of twenty-six plus or minus some fixed amount (e.g., two or three) will also work because these modified expressions still contain both three AND nine within their respective prime factorizations.\nGiven this realization, it becomes evident there are many potential answers beyond the simplest one ('27').\n\nAnswer: The number that satisfies the given condition could be any whole multiple of twenty-six plus or minus some fixed amount as long as it contains both three and nine within its prime factors.",

It means we've made a mistake somewhere in our calculations or reasoning.\n\nStep 4: Review the problem statement for any details that might have been missed\nWe're given that John will be twice as old as Sam in six years. If S is Sam's current age, then J would be (3S) now. In six years, J becomes (J + 6), and S also becomes older by six years: (S + 6). The problem states \"John will be twice as old as Sam\" in six years - not that John's age is currently twice Sam's plus an extra six years.\n\nStep 5: Revise the approach considering this new information\nWe can restate our initial equation J = 3S as saying \"John's current age is three times what Sam's current age is\". This aligns with the problem statement. \n\nGiven that John will be twice as old as Sam in six years, we know that if S were -6 right now (which was ruled out earlier), then:\nJ = 3(-6) = -18\nAnd in six years:\nS + 6 = -6 + 6 = 0\nSo J would indeed become twice what S is after adding the six years.\n\nNow we have a correct initial condition, and our future prediction aligns with this.

We need to find Q's speed if P's speed is given as 24 m/s.\n\nStep 2: Calculate Q's Distance Traveled\nSince P beats Q, P covers an additional 125 meters beyond the full kilometer (1000 meters) that Q ran.\nQ's total distance = 1000 + 125 = 1125 meters\n\nStep 3: Use Relative Speed to Find Time Difference\nRelative speed is the difference between the speeds of two objects moving in opposite directions. Here, P and Q are moving in opposite directions with respect to each other during the race.\nTime difference (t) can be calculated using the formula:\nDistance = Speed × Time\nSince we know P's speed as 24 m/s and there's a 125-meter advantage for P over Q, we have:\n125 = 24(t)\nSolving for t gives us the time difference between when P completes one kilometer and when Q completes it.\n\nStep 4: Calculate Q's Total Time\nWe can now calculate how long it took Q to cover his total distance (1125 meters):\nTime = Distance / Speed\nQ's total time = 1125 / 24 ≈ 46.88 minutes\n\nStep 5: Find Q's Average Speed\nTo find Q's average speed, we need to divide the total distance he ran by the total time taken.\nQ's average speed = Total Distance / Total Time\n= 1125 meters / (46.88*60) seconds\n≈ 25 m/s\n\nStep 6: Provide a Detailed Answer with Calculation\nAnswer: Q runs at an average speed of approximately 25 meters per second.\n\nAnswer Explanation: To find the distance that P needs to cover after beating Q, we subtract the distance that Q ran from the total race length (1 km = 1000 m):\nDistance advantage for P = 125 m\nNew total distance for P = 1000 + 125 = 1125 m\n\nSince both are running at constant speeds throughout the race and meet each other at some point during this extra 125 meters covered by P, we can calculate how long it took them to meet.\nRelative speed (R) is the sum of their individual speeds because they're moving in the same direction for part of the race. We know P's speed as 24 m/s; hence Q's speed must be:\nQ's speed = Relative speed - P's speed\n= R - 24 m/s\n\nNow, let's calculate how much time it took them to meet based on this relative speed.\nTime (t) can be found using the formula: Distance = Speed × Time\nRelative distance covered by both before meeting = 125 m (given)\nUsing relative speed:\nRelative distance = Relative speed × Time\nt = Relative distance / Relative speed\n= 125/25 ≈ 5 minutes\n\nNow that we have the time difference, let's find Q's total running time.\nQ's total time = Total distance / Speed\n= 1125 m / (24 + 25) ≈ 46.88 minutes\n\nFinally, to calculate Q's average speed, divide his total distance by this total time:\nAverage speed of Q = Total Distance / Total Time\n≈ 25 m/s",
