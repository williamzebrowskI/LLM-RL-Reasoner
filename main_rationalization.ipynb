       "  'rationale': '.\\nStep-by-step reasoning:\\n\\n1. We are given that the cost of fencing is Rs.10 per meter.\\n2. The area of the farm is 1200 m^2 and its short side is 30 m long.\\n3. To find the total length of fence required, we need to consider the perimeter formed by fencing one long side, one short side and the diagonal.\\n4. Since the rectangular farm has a square corner (i.e., right angle), the triangle formed by connecting the endpoints of these three sides will be a right triangle with its hypotenuse being this diagonal line segment.\\n5. We can use Pythagoras\\' theorem to find the length of this diagonal: long side^2 = short side^2 + diagonal^2 → diagonal^2 = 1200 - (30)^2\\n6. Taking square root on both sides gives us diagonal = √(1200 - 900) = √300.\\n7. Now, perimeter = sum of all sides = long side + short side + diagonal. \\n8. Substituting values:\\nperimeter = 30 + √300\\n9. To find total cost, multiply the perimeter found in step #8 by Rs.10 per meter (given in step #1):\\ntotal cost = perimeter * 10 = (30 + √300) * 10.\\n10. Simplifying this expression gives us: total cost = 300 + 10√300.\\n\\nAnd now finally comes the answer part:\\n\"Answer:\"\\n\\nDouble-check that there are no errors or contradictions between your reasoning and the provided answer.',\n",
