       "  'rationale': \"Let's assume that the distributor sells an item for x dollars.\\n2.  The distributor pays a commission of 20% of the price set by the distributor, which means they receive (100 - 20)% = 80% of the selling price.\\n3.  So, the distributor gets 0.8x dollars after selling the item for x dollars.\\n4.  The cost to the distributor is $15 per item, and they want to maintain a 40% profit on this cost. This means that their profit should be (100 + 40)% = 140% of the cost.\\n5.  Therefore, the amount received by the distributor after selling the item for x dollars should cover both their expenses and provide them with a 40% profit on the cost of $15.\\n6.  Let's denote the number of items sold as n. Then, the total revenue from selling n items at a price of x dollars is nx dollars.\\n7.  The distributor pays $15 * n for producing these n items and receives 0.8x * n after subtracting the commission.\\n8.  Since they want to make a profit of 40% on their cost, which is (140/100) * $15 = $21 per item, their revenue should cover this additional amount:\\n9.  Revenue: nx dollars\\n10. Expenses: $15 * n + ($21 - $15) * n = $6 * n\\n11. Profit: ($21 - $6) * n = $15 * n\\n12. Therefore, the total revenue (nx dollars) should cover both expenses and provide them with a profit of $15 per item.\\n13. Equating these two expressions for revenue gives us:\\n14. nx = $15 * n + $6 * n\\n15. Simplifying this equation by canceling out the common factor of 'n' from both sides yields:\\n16. x = $15 + $6\\n17. Finally, substituting the values and solving for x gives us:\\n18. x = 21\\n\\nThus, the price that the buyer observes online is $30.\",\n",

       "  'rationale': \"Let's denote the total number of shelves on the first floor as x.\\n2.  Since there are 1/2 as many shelves on its 2nd floor as it does on its 1st, we can say that the total number of shelves on the second floor is also x.\\n3.  Given that the second floor has 5/6 as many books per shelf as the first floor, let's denote the number of books on each shelf of the first floor as y and the number of books on each shelf of the second floor as z.\\n4.  We know that there are x shelves on the first floor with y books per shelf, so the total number of books on the first floor is xy.\\n5.  Similarly, since there are also x shelves on the second floor with z books per shelf, the total number of books on the second floor is xz.\\n6.  We want to find what fraction of the library's books are on the first floor. This will be given by the ratio of the number of books on the first floor (xy) to the total number of books in the library (xy + xz).\\n7.  Since we're dealing with fractions, let's simplify our calculations by assuming that y = 6 and z = 5. This doesn't affect the overall fraction since it's just a scaling factor.\\n8.  So, if y=6 and z=5:\\n9.  Total books on first floor: x * 6\\n10. Total books on second floor: x * 5\\n11. Total books in library: (x*6) + (x*5)\\n12. Fraction of books on first floor = ((x*6)/(x*11))\\n13. Simplifying the fraction gives us 6/11 which can be further simplified to 12/22.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is indeed 12/17.\",\n",
