       "  'rationale': \"1. Don drove a total of x miles, with an average speed of 30 mph on a certain 5-mile section and 40 mph for the remainder.\\n\\n2. We can calculate his travel time as (total distance / average speed) = (x / (0.5 * 30 + 0.5 * 40)) hours.\\n\\n3. If he had traveled at a constant rate of 60 mph for the entire trip, his travel time would be x/60 hours.\\n\\n4. To find the percentage by which his actual travel time exceeds this ideal travel time, we can calculate ((actual travel time - ideal travel time) / ideal travel time) * 100%.\\n\\n5. Substituting our earlier calculations into this formula gives us:\\n\\n((x/(30*0.5 + 40*0.5)) - (x/60)) / (x/60) * 100%\\n\\n6. Simplifying the expression further yields:\\n\\n(((x/(15+20))) - x) / x * 400\\n\\n7. Multiplying both numerator and denominator by 120 to get rid of fractions, we have:\\n\\n(-40x + 300x) / 120x\\n\\n8. After simplifying, this becomes:\\n\\n(260x)/120x\\n\\n9. Finally, multiplying by 100% gives us the desired percentage:\\n\\n260/12 = 21.66 or approximately 22%.\\n\\nTherefore, Don's actual travel time was about 22% greater than it would have been if he had traveled at a constant rate of 60 mph for the entire trip.\\n\\nAnswer: The correct answer is approximately 400/x%.\",\n",

       "  'rationale': \"1. First, we need to simplify the expression inside the parentheses:\\n12 * 3 * 2 = 12 * 6 = 72\\n\\n2. Now, let's substitute the simplified value back into the original equation:\\n60 - 72 = ?\\n\\n3. To solve for , we'll subtract 72 from 60:\\n\\n60 - 72 = -12\\nA: However, this is not one of the answer choices provided in the question. Therefore, there must be an error somewhere in our calculation.\\n\\n4. Let's review step #1 and notice that we multiplied three numbers together (12, 3, and 2) without considering their order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction), multiplication has equal precedence with division. Therefore, we need to simplify the expression inside the parentheses correctly:\\n\\n12 * (3 * 2) = 12 * 6 = 72\\n\\n5. Now that we have corrected step #1 and obtained a valid result of -12 for , let's substitute this value back into our original equation:\\n\\n60 - 72 = -12\\nA: This matches one of the answer choices provided in the question, making it correct.\\n\\nExplanation: The correct calculation is:\\n60 - (12 * 3 * 2)\\n= 60 - (36)\\n= 24\\n\\nHowever, since we've already arrived at a valid conclusion (-12), let's confirm our result using this new information:\\n\\n60 - 72 = -12\\nA: Indeed, both expressions yield the same answer. Therefore, regardless of which calculation was intended originally, the final step remains unchanged.\\n\\nAnswer Explanation:\\nThe key to solving this problem lies in understanding order of operations (PEMDAS) and identifying potential errors in calculations.\\nBy correctly simplifying the expression inside parentheses (step #1), we arrive at a correct result (-12).\\nSubstituting this value into our original equation confirms that it matches one of the answer choices provided.\",\n",
