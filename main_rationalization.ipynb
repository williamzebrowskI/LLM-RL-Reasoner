The price of the bank decreased by 10%: Similarly, if the initial price was y dollars, then after a decrease of 10%, its new value would be (y - 0.1y) = 0.9y dollars.\\n3. The computer company also decreased by 15%: If its original cost was z dollars, then after an adjustment downward by 15%, its worth would become (z - 0.15z) = 0.85z dollars.\\n4. Overall value increased: Since Samantha owns equal amounts of all three stocks (airline, bank, and computer), we can represent her portfolio as a sum: x + y + z.\\n\\nGiven that the overall value increased despite some stock prices falling, let's analyze this situation further:\\n\\n5. If one stock price rises by 10% while another decreases by 15%, it means there was initially more money invested in the former than the latter - otherwise, why would such a change result in an increase? Let's say x > y > z.\\n6.

The distributor obtains the product from a producer at the price of $15 per item. What is the price that the buyer observers on-line if the distributor wants to maintain a 40% profit on the cost of the item?',\n",
       "  'rationale': \"Step 1: Determine the commission taken by the online store.\\nThe online store takes a commission of 20% of the price set by the distributor. This means that for every $1 sold, the distributor receives $0.80 after paying the commission.\\n\\nStep 2: Calculate the profit margin desired by the distributor.\\nThe distributor wants to maintain a 40% profit on the cost of the item. This means that for every $1 spent on producing and distributing the item, the distributor hopes to make a profit of $0.40.\\n\\nStep 3: Determine the price at which the distributor sells the item after paying the commission.\\nLet's assume that x is the original price set by the distributor before any commissions or profits are taken into account. The distributor receives $0.80 for every $1 sold, so their actual revenue is $0.80x (since they receive 80 cents for every dollar). To maintain a 40% profit margin, the distributor needs to make a profit of $0.40 per item. This means that the price at which the buyer observes online must be such that, after paying the commission and other costs, the distributor still makes a profit of $0.40 per item.\\n\\nStep 4: Calculate the final price observed by the buyer.\\nThe distributor receives $0.80 for every dollar sold, so their actual revenue is $0.80x. To make a profit of $0.40 per item after paying all expenses (including the commission), they need to sell each item at a price that allows them to make a total profit of $0.40 on every dollar spent producing and distributing it.\\n\\nLet's denote y as the final price observed by the buyer after commissions and other costs have been taken into account. The distributor receives $0.80 for every dollar sold, so their actual revenue is $0.80x. To make a profit of $0.40 per item after paying all expenses (including the commission), they need to sell each item at a price that allows them to make a total profit of $0.40 on every dollar spent producing and distributing it.\\n\\nThis means that the final price observed by the buyer must be such that, when multiplied by 0.8 (since the distributor receives only $0.80 for every $1 sold), gives a value greater than or equal to $15 (the cost of producing one item). In other words:\\n\\ny * 0.8 >= $15\\n\\nDividing both sides by 0.8 to isolate y, we get:\\n\\ny >= $15 / 0.8\\n\\nSimplifying this expression, we find that the final price observed by the buyer must be at least:\\n\\ny >= $18.75\\n\\nSince prices are usually rounded up to whole numbers for convenience, let's assume that the actual price set by the distributor after paying all expenses is indeed $18.75 per item.\\n\\nStep 5: Verify that this price satisfies both conditions given in the problem statement.\\nLet's verify that selling each item at a price of $18.75 meets the requirements stated in the question:\\n\\n1) The commission taken by the online store is 20% of the final price set by the distributor, which was assumed to be $18.75 per item.\\n\\nCommission = Final Price * 0.2\\n= $18.75 * 0.2\\n= $3.75\\n\\nSince this amount ($3.75) has already been subtracted from the original cost of producing one item ($15), it represents a valid commission taken by the online store on each sale.\\n\\n2) The distributor wants to maintain a 40% profit margin on their cost of acquiring and distributing each item, which was assumed to be $15 per item.\\n\\nProfit = Final Price - Cost\\n= $18.75 - $15\\n= $3.75\\n\\nThis means that for every dollar spent producing and distributing one item ($15), the distributor makes a profit of $0.40 after selling it at a price of $18.75.\\n\\nSince this profit is indeed 40% of their original cost (i.e., $15), it satisfies the requirement stated in the problem.\\n\\nTherefore, we can conclude that if the distributor sells each item for $18.75 and takes a commission of 20%, they will make a total profit of $3.75 per item after paying all expenses - meeting both conditions given in the original question.\",\n",
