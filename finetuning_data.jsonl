[{"from": "human", "value": "Question: q is a positive integer and multiple of 2; p = 4^q, what is the remainder when p is divided by 10?\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "6\nRationale: To find the remainder when p is divided by 10, we first need to understand the pattern of remainders for powers of 4.\n\nThe remainder of a number can be found by looking at its last digit. When we raise a number to different powers, the last digit follows a specific pattern. For example, when you square a number (i.e., raise it to the power of 2), the possible remainders are always among the set {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9}.\n\nNow, since 4 raised to any positive integer will end in one of the digits from this set, let's find which digit appears when raising 4 to consecutive powers. We get:\n\n- 4^1 = 4\n- 4^2 = 16 (ends with 6)\n- 4^3 = 64 (ends with 4)\n- 4^4 = 256 (ends with 6)\n- 4^5 = 1024 (ends with 4)\n\nWe can see that the remainders alternate between 4 and 6.\n\nGiven q is a positive integer and multiple of 2, it means we are always raising 4 to an even power. This implies the remainder will be either 4 or 6 when divided by 10.\n\nHowever, since p = 4^q, if q is a multiple of 2 (an even number), p will end in 6, not 4. Therefore, when we divide p by 10, we are left with a remainder of 6.\n\nAnswer: 6"}]

[{"from": "human", "value": "Question: A sum is invested for 3 years compounded at 5%, 10% and 20 % respectively. In three years, if the sum amounts to Rs. 1386, then find the sum.\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "$1000\nRationale: To find the initial sum that was invested, we can use the formula for compound interest:\n\nA = P(1 + r/100)^n\n\nwhere A is the final amount, P is the principal (initial) amount, r is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of years.\n\nIn this case, we have three different interest rates for each year, so we will apply the formula separately for each year and then multiply the results to get the final amount after three years.\n\nLet's denote the initial sum as P. After one year at 5%, the amount becomes:\n\nA1 = P(1 + 0.05)^1\n= P(1.05)\n\nAfter two years, we add the interest for the second year (10%) to A1:\n\nA2 = A1(1 + 0.10)^1\n= P(1.05)(1.10)\n= P(1.05)(1.10)\n= P(1.155)\n\nFinally, after three years, we add the interest for the third year (20%) to A2:\n\nA3 = A2(1 + 0.20)^1\n= P(1.155)(1.20)\n= P(1.155)(1.20)\n= P(1.386)\n\nWe are given that A3 = Rs. 1386, so we can solve for P:\n\nP(1.386) = 1386\n\nDividing both sides by 1.386 gives us the initial sum:\n\nP = 1386 / 1.386\n= 1000\n\nTherefore, the initial sum was Rs. 1000.\n\nAnswer: $1000"}]

The reciprocal of 0 would be 1/0, which is undefined in mathematics. This is because division by zero is not allowed in mathematics.\n\nTherefore, the number that does not have a reciprocal is zero (0).\n\nAnswer: 0"}]
