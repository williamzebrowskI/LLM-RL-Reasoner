[{"from": "human", "value": "Question: q is a positive integer and multiple of 2; p = 4^q, what is the remainder when p is divided by 10?\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "6\nRationale: To find the remainder when p is divided by 10, we first need to understand the pattern of remainders for powers of 4.\n\nThe remainder of a number can be found by looking at its last digit. When we raise a number to different powers, the last digit follows a specific pattern. For example, when you square a number (i.e., raise it to the power of 2), the possible remainders are always among the set {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9}.\n\nNow, since 4 raised to any positive integer will end in one of the digits from this set, let's find which digit appears when raising 4 to consecutive powers. We get:\n\n- 4^1 = 4\n- 4^2 = 16 (ends with 6)\n- 4^3 = 64 (ends with 4)\n- 4^4 = 256 (ends with 6)\n- 4^5 = 1024 (ends with 4)\n\nWe can see that the remainders alternate between 4 and 6.\n\nGiven q is a positive integer and multiple of 2, it means we are always raising 4 to an even power. This implies the remainder will be either 4 or 6 when divided by 10.\n\nHowever, since p = 4^q, if q is a multiple of 2 (an even number), p will end in 6, not 4. Therefore, when we divide p by 10, we are left with a remainder of 6.\n\nAnswer: 6"}]
[{"from": "human", "value": "Question: If Tim had lunch at $50 and he gave 20% tip, how much did he spend?\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "$60\nRationale: To find out how much Tim spent on lunch, we need to calculate the amount of the tip and add it to the cost of the lunch.\n\nThe cost of the lunch is $50. \n\nA 20% tip means that 20% of the cost of the lunch should be added as a tip. To find 20% of $50, we can multiply $50 by 0.2 (since 20% is equivalent to 0.2).\n\nTip = $50 * 0.2 = $10\n\nNow, we need to add the cost of the lunch and the tip to find out how much Tim spent in total.\n\nTotal amount spent = Cost of lunch + Tip\n= $50 + $10\n= $60\n\nTherefore, Tim spent a total of $60 on lunch.\n\nAnswer: $60"}]

Estimate the size of the population net increase that occurs in one day.\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "86400\nRationale: To find the size of the population net increase in one day, we need to calculate the number of people born and died in a day and then subtract the number of deaths from the number of births.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of people born every two seconds:\n\nBirth rate = 8 people every two seconds\n\nThere are 4320 seconds in an hour (60 minutes x 60 seconds/minute), 86400 seconds in a day (24 hours x 3600 seconds/hour). So, we can divide 86400 by 2 to get the number of intervals of two seconds in a day:\n\n86400 / 2 = 43200 intervals\n\nNow, multiply the birth rate by the number of intervals to get the total number of people born in a day:\n\n8 people/interval x 43200 intervals = 345600 people\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of people died every two seconds:\n\nDeath rate = 6 people every two seconds\n\nMultiply the death rate by the number of intervals to get the total number of people died in a day:\n\n6 people/interval x 43200 intervals = 259200 people\n\nNow, subtract the number of deaths from the number of births to find the size of the population net increase in one day:\n\n345600 (births) - 259200 (deaths) = 86400 people\n\nTherefore, the size of the population net increase that occurs in one day is 86400.\n\nAnswer: 86400"}]
