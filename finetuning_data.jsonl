[{"from": "human", "value": "Question: q is a positive integer and multiple of 2; p = 4^q, what is the remainder when p is divided by 10?\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "6\nRationale: To find the remainder when p is divided by 10, we first need to understand the pattern of remainders for powers of 4.\n\nThe remainder of a number can be found by looking at its last digit. When we raise a number to different powers, the last digit follows a specific pattern. For example, when you square a number (i.e., raise it to the power of 2), the possible remainders are always among the set {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9}.\n\nNow, since 4 raised to any positive integer will end in one of the digits from this set, let's find which digit appears when raising 4 to consecutive powers. We get:\n\n- 4^1 = 4\n- 4^2 = 16 (ends with 6)\n- 4^3 = 64 (ends with 4)\n- 4^4 = 256 (ends with 6)\n- 4^5 = 1024 (ends with 4)\n\nWe can see that the remainders alternate between 4 and 6.\n\nGiven q is a positive integer and multiple of 2, it means we are always raising 4 to an even power. This implies the remainder will be either 4 or 6 when divided by 10.\n\nHowever, since p = 4^q, if q is a multiple of 2 (an even number), p will end in 6, not 4. Therefore, when we divide p by 10, we are left with a remainder of 6.\n\nAnswer: 6"}]

The rabbit is fed a mixture of two foods, food X and food Y, which contains 300 grams in total.\n2. Food X contains 10% protein, so for every 100 grams of food X, there are 10 grams of protein.\n3. Similarly, food Y contains 15% protein, so for every 100 grams of food Y, there are 15 grams of protein.\n4. The rabbit's diet provides exactly 39 grams of protein daily, and this is made up of a mixture of food X and food Y.\n5. Let x be the number of grams of food X in the mixture, and let y be the number of grams of food Y in the mixture. We know that x + y = 300 (since there are 300 grams of the mixture in total).\n6. Since food X contains 10% protein, the amount of protein from food X is 0.1x.\n7. Similarly, since food Y contains 15% protein, the amount of protein from food Y is 0.15y.\n8. We know that the total amount of protein in the diet is 39 grams, so we can set up the equation: 0.1x + 0.15y = 39.\n9.

Since a certain number of men can do a work in 20 days, we can say that the total amount of work done by the men is proportional to the product of the number of men and the number of days they worked. Therefore, we can write an equation: Work = kx \\* 20, where k is a constant.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the situation when there are 4 more men added to the original group of x men. The total number of men now becomes (x + 4).\n\n4. According to the problem statement, with the additional 4 men, the work can be completed in 5 days less than before. This means that the total amount of work done by the new group of (x + 4) men is still proportional to the product of their number and the number of days they worked: Work = k(x + 4) \\* 15.\n\n5.

The difference in speed is 45 - 36 = 9 kmph.\n\nStep 2: Convert the difference in speed from kmph to minutes per hour.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the speed difference into minutes by dividing by the train's normal hourly distance it could have traveled if it didn't stop. Let's assume x as the total time for which the train runs without stopping (speed excluding stoppages). The speed of the train excluding stoppages is 45 kmph and including stoppages is 36 kmph.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the actual time spent by the train on running in an hour.\nThe actual time spent by the train while running, i.e., not stopping is (45/100) * 60 = 27 minutes. The difference between the maximum speed and minimum speed of the train can be calculated as: (45 - 36) * (1/45) * 60.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the actual time spent by the train on stopping in an hour.\nNow, let's calculate how long it takes for the train to cover the distance that would have been covered at its full speed if there were no stoppages. This will be calculated as: (9/45) * 60 = (1/5) * 60 = 12 minutes.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the actual time spent by the train on stopping in an hour.\nNow, we know that the total number of minutes for which the train runs without stopping is 27 minutes and it stops for x - 27 minutes. Hence, to find out how many minutes does the train stop per hour, we need to subtract the total running time from the total time.\n\nStep 6: Finally calculate the actual time spent by the train on stopping in an hour.\nTotal running time = Total time per hour - Stopping time per hour\n= 60 - 12\n= 48 minutes\n\nStep 7: So, we can conclude that the train stops for 12 minutes every hour.\n\n\n\nAnswer: 12"}]

The average score of Scott's first four rounds is 18. This means that the total score of these four rounds is 4 x 18 = 72.\n\n2. To drop his average score by 2 points, Scott needs to have a lower total score after five rounds. Let's call the score on the fifth round 'x'. The new total score will be 72 + x.\n\n3.

[{"from": "human", "value": "Question: A cistern can be filled by a tap in 6 hours while it can be emptied by another tap in 12 hours. If both the taps are opened simultaneously, then after how much time will the cistern get filled?\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "12\nRationale: Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. The first tap can fill the cistern in 6 hours, which means it fills 1/6 of the cistern in one hour.\n2. The second tap can empty the cistern in 12 hours, which means it empties 1/12 of the cistern in one hour.\n3. When both taps are opened simultaneously, their rates of filling and emptying the cistern add up. So, the net rate at which the cistern is being filled is (1/6 - 1/12) per hour.\n4. To find the common denominator, we can convert 1/6 to 2/12 and 1/12 remains as it is. So, the net rate becomes (2/12 - 1/12) = 1/12 per hour.\n5. This means that together, the taps fill 1/12 of the cistern in one hour.\n6. Since the first tap alone can fill the entire cistern in 6 hours, and now it's being helped by the second tap which adds to its rate, we need to find how much time it will take for both taps working together to fill the cistern.\n\nThe formula to calculate the combined rate is: (Rate of filling + Rate of emptying) = Combined rate.\n\nHere, the combined rate is 1/6 (rate of filling by tap 1) - 1/12 (rate of emptying by tap 2) per hour.\n\nSince we already calculated that their combined rate is 1/12 per hour, we need to find how long it takes for the combined rate of 1/12 to fill the cistern. Since it's a simple inverse relationship, if the first tap can fill the cistern in 6 hours (which means its filling rate is 1/6), and when both taps work together their net rate is 1/12 per hour, we simply multiply the time taken by the individual rate of the slower tap to get the time taken by the combined rates.\n\nHence, it will take 6 * 2 = 12 hours for the cistern to be filled completely with both taps working together.\n\nAnswer: 12"}]

The letters are L, O, G, A, R, I, T, H, M, and S. There are 10 unique letters.\n\nSince we want to form a 4-letter word without repetition, we can choose any 4 letters out of the 10 unique letters. This is a combination problem, and we can calculate it as follows:\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!)\n= 10! / (4!6!)\n= (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6!) / (4!6!)\n= (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7) / (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)\n= 5040 / 24\n= 210\n\nSo, there are 210 ways to choose the 4 letters for our word.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of arrangements of these 4 letters. Since repetition is not allowed and the order matters (because it's a word), this is a permutation problem. We can calculate it as follows:\n\nP(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!)\n= 10! / (4!6!)\n(same calculation as above)\n\nHowever, we are choosing 4 letters out of the 10 unique letters, and then arranging them in different ways. We can also think of it this way: for each choice of 4 letters, there are 4! = 24 ways to arrange them.\n\nSo, the total number of arrangements is the product of the number of choices (210) and the number of arrangements per choice (24):\n\nTotal arrangements = 210 \u00d7 24\n= 5040\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 5040 different 4-letter words that can be formed out of the letters of the word \"LOGARITHMS\" without allowing repetition of letters.\n\nAnswer: 5040"}]

Find the total number of votes polled in the election?\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "15000\nRationale: Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The winner has a margin of 20% of the votes polled, which means that if x is the total number of votes polled, then the difference between the votes for the winner and the loser is 0.2x.\n2. If 3000 people change their mind and vote for the loser, the loser would have won by a margin of 20% of the votes polled, which means that the difference between the votes for the loser and the winner would be -0.2(x-3000).\n3. Since the absolute value of the difference is the same in both cases (because it's a margin), we can set up an equation: |0.2x| = |-0.2(x-3000)|.\n4. Simplifying the equation, we get 0.2|x| = -0.2(x-3000).\n5. Dividing both sides by -0.2 (and remembering that x is a positive number because it's a count of votes), we get |x| = x - 15000.\n6. Now, since the absolute value of x is just x itself in this case (because x is already a positive number), we can simplify further: x = x - 15000.\n7. Subtracting x from both sides gives us 0 = -15000.\n8. This equation doesn't make sense because it implies that something can be equal to zero and also be a negative value at the same time, which is a logical contradiction.\n\nHowever, we know that votes are always positive numbers. Therefore, let's look at our steps again. In step 4, we said |0.2x| = |-0.2(x-3000)|. This equation should have x as its solution because it represents the total number of votes polled in both cases.\n\nConsidering this, let's correct our approach:\n\nWe can simplify the equation |0.2x| = |-0.2(x-3000)| to get 0.2|x| = 0.2(x - 15000).\n\nNow, we divide both sides by 0.2 (which is positive), so it doesn't affect the direction of the inequality:\n\n|x| = x - 15000\n\nThis equation still has a logical contradiction because x cannot be equal to itself minus 15000 and also not be zero.\n\nHowever, looking at this from a different perspective: we know that if there are x votes for the winner, then (x - 0.2x) votes are actually votes for the loser in the first case. If 3000 people switch sides, then (x-3000 - 0.2(x - 3000)) = (x - 15000) would be votes for the winner.\n\nGiven this information, let's recalculate the number of votes polled using a new perspective:\n\nLet x be the total number of votes polled in the election initially.\n\nInitially, votes for the winner: x\nvotes for the loser: x - 0.2x = 0.8x\n\nNow, if 3000 people switch sides and vote for the loser, then:\nvotes for the loser are now (0.8x + 3000)\n\nGiven that this would result in a 20% margin of votes polled for the winner:\n\n(x - (0.8x + 3000)) = 0.2(x) \n\nThis equation simplifies to: \n(-0.2x + 3000) = 0.2(x)\n-0.4x + 6000 = 0\n-0.4x = -6000\n\nDividing by -0.4:\n\nx = 15000\n\nSo the total number of votes polled in the election initially is indeed 15000.\n\nAnswer: 15000"}]

The charge for a single room at Hotel R is what percent greater than the charge for a single room at Hotel G?\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "80%\nRationale: To find the answer, let's first denote the charge for a single room at Hotel G as x.\n\nThe charge for a single room at Hotel P is 10% less than the charge for a single room at Hotel G. This means that it is 90% of the charge at Hotel G, which can be calculated as 0.9x.\n\nIt's also given that the charge for a single room at Hotel P is 50% less than the charge for a single room at Hotel R. Let's denote the charge for a single room at Hotel R as y. This means that the charge at Hotel P, which we previously calculated as 0.9x, is also 50% less than y. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\n0.9x = (1 - 0.5)y\n0.9x = 0.5y\n\nNow, let's solve for y in terms of x:\n\n0.5y = 0.9x\ny = 0.9x / 0.5\ny = 1.8x\n\nWe're asked to find the percentage by which the charge at Hotel R is greater than the charge at Hotel G, i.e., (y - x) / x * 100.\n\nUsing our expression for y from above:\n\n(y - x) / x = (1.8x - x) / x\n= 0.8x / x\n= 0.8\n\nTo convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\n= 0.8 * 100\n= 80%\n\nTherefore, the charge for a single room at Hotel R is 80% greater than the charge for a single room at Hotel G.\n\nAnswer: 80%"}]

Fuel A contains 12% ethanol by volume and fuel B contains 16% ethanol by volume. If the full fuel tank contains 30 gallons of ethanol, how many gallons of fuel A were added?\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "50\nRationale: To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: Define the variables.\nLet x be the number of gallons of fuel A added to the tank. Then, (200 - x) will be the number of gallons of fuel B added.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the amount of ethanol in fuel A and fuel B.\nFuel A contains 12% ethanol by volume, so the amount of ethanol in fuel A is 0.12x gallons.\nFuel B contains 16% ethanol by volume, so the amount of ethanol in fuel B is 0.16(200 - x) gallons.\n\nStep 3: Set up an equation based on the total amount of ethanol in the full tank.\nThe sum of the ethanol in fuel A and fuel B equals the total amount of ethanol in the full tank, which is given as 30 gallons. Therefore:\n0.12x + 0.16(200 - x) = 30\n\nStep 4: Solve for x using the equation from Step 3.\nFirst, distribute the 0.16 to the terms inside the parentheses:\n0.12x + 32 - 0.16x = 30\nNext, combine like terms and simplify the equation:\n-0.04x + 32 = 30\nSubtract 32 from both sides of the equation:\n-0.04x = -2\nNow, divide both sides by -0.04 to solve for x:\nx = 50\n\nSo, 50 gallons of fuel A were added.\n\nAnswer: 50"}]
[{"from": "human", "value": "Question: Daniel went to a shop and bought things worth Rs. 25, out of which 30 Paise went on sales tax on taxable purchases. If the tax rate was 5%, then what was the cost of the tax free items?\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "$18.70\nRationale: To find the cost of the tax-free items, let's first calculate the total value of the taxable purchases.\n\nLet's denote the cost of the taxable purchases as x. Since the sales tax on these purchases is 30 paise (which is equal to Rs. 0.30), we can use the tax rate formula:\n\nTax = Tax Rate \u00d7 Cost of Taxable Purchases\n\nGiven that the tax rate is 5% and the tax amount is Rs. 0.30, we can set up the equation as follows:\n\n0.30 = (5/100) \u00d7 x\n\nTo find x, multiply both sides by 100 and divide by 5:\n\nx = 0.30 \u00d7 100 / 5\nx = 6\n\nSo, the cost of the taxable purchases is Rs. 6.\n\nNow, let's find the total value of all items purchased (which includes both tax-free and taxable items). We know that Daniel spent a total of Rs. 25 on everything. Out of this amount, the cost of the tax-free items can be found by subtracting the sum of the tax and the cost of the taxable purchases from the total.\n\nCost of Tax-Free Items = Total Cost - (Tax + Cost of Taxable Purchases)\n= 25 - (0.30 + 6)\n\nFirst, convert Rs. 0.30 to whole numbers:\n0.30 = 30 paise = Rs. 0.30\n\nThen subtract the tax amount and the cost of taxable purchases from the total cost:\n\nCost of Tax-Free Items = 25 - 36.3 (after converting 0.30 to Rs.)\n= -11.3\n\nThis calculation is incorrect because we cannot have a negative value for the cost of items.\n\nRecalculate the cost of tax-free items by adding the tax and cost of taxable purchases in rupees:\n\nTax = 30 paise = Rs. 0.30\nCost of Taxable Purchases = Rs. 6\n\nSo, when adding these values together, we should get:\nTotal Cost of Tax-Free Items = Total Amount - (Tax + Cost of Taxable Purchases)\n= 25 - (0.30 + 6)\n\nFirst, add the tax amount and cost of taxable purchases:\n0.30 + 6 = 6.30\n\nThen subtract this sum from the total cost:\n\nCost of Tax-Free Items = 25 - 6.3\n= 18.7\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with a currency that only accepts whole numbers (paise) for small amounts, it's more accurate to represent these values in terms of paise.\n\nLet's convert this value back into rupees:\nCost of Tax-Free Items = 25 - 6.3\n= 18.7\n\nConverting the tax amount and cost of taxable purchases from rupees to paise for easier calculation:\nTax = Rs. 0.30 = 30 paise\nCost of Taxable Purchases = Rs. 6 = 600 paise\n\nNow calculate the total value in paise:\nTotal Value in Paise = Total Cost \u00d7 100 (since we're dealing with rupees and want to convert everything into paise for easier calculation)\n= 25 \u00d7 100\n= 2500 paise\n\nNext, subtract the sum of tax amount and cost of taxable purchases from this total:\n\nCost of Tax-Free Items in Paise = Total Value - (Tax + Cost of Taxable Purchases)\n= 2500 - (30 + 600)\n\nSimplify inside the parentheses:\nTotal Value in Paise - (Tax + Cost of Taxable Purchases) \n= 2500 - 630\n= 1870\n\nTo convert this back into rupees, divide by 100:\nCost of Tax-Free Items = 1870 / 100\n= Rs. 18.70\n\nSo, the cost of tax-free items is approximately Rs. 18.70.\n\nAnswer: $18.70"}]
