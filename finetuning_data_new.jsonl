{"text": "Q: q is a positive integer and multiple of 2; p = 4^q, what is the remainder when p is divided by 10?\nA: To find the remainder when p is divided by 10, we first need to understand the pattern of remainders for powers of 4.\n\nThe remainder of a number can be found by looking at its last digit. When we raise a number to different powers, the last digit follows a specific pattern. For example, when you square a number (i.e., raise it to the power of 2), the possible remainders are always among the set {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9}.\n\nNow, since 4 raised to any positive integer will end in one of the digits from this set, let's find which digit appears when raising 4 to consecutive powers. We get:\n\n- 4^1 = 4\n- 4^2 = 16 (ends with 6)\n- 4^3 = 64 (ends with 4)\n- 4^4 = 256 (ends with 6)\n- 4^5 = 1024 (ends with 4)\n\nWe can see that the remainders alternate between 4 and 6.\n\nGiven q is a positive integer and multiple of 2, it means we are always raising 4 to an even power. This implies the remainder will be either 4 or 6 when divided by 10.\n\nHowever, since p = 4^q, if q is a multiple of 2 (an even number), p will end in 6, not 4. Therefore, when we divide p by 10, we are left with a remainder of 6."}

Estimate the size of the population net increase that occurs in one day.\nA: To find the size of the population net increase in one day, we need to calculate the number of people born and died in a day and then subtract the number of deaths from the number of births.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of people born every two seconds:\n\nBirth rate = 8 people every two seconds\n\nThere are 4320 seconds in an hour (60 minutes x 60 seconds/minute), 86400 seconds in a day (24 hours x 3600 seconds/hour). So, we can divide 86400 by 2 to get the number of intervals of two seconds in a day:\n\n86400 / 2 = 43200 intervals\n\nNow, multiply the birth rate by the number of intervals to get the total number of people born in a day:\n\n8 people/interval x 43200 intervals = 345600 people\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of people died every two seconds:\n\nDeath rate = 6 people every two seconds\n\nMultiply the death rate by the number of intervals to get the total number of people died in a day:\n\n6 people/interval x 43200 intervals = 259200 people\n\nNow, subtract the number of deaths from the number of births to find the size of the population net increase in one day:\n\n345600 (births) - 259200 (deaths) = 86400 people\n\nTherefore, the size of the population net increase that occurs in one day is 86400."}

If the rabbit's diet provides exactly 39 grams of protein daily, how many grams of food X are in the mixture.\nA: Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The rabbit is fed a mixture of two foods, food X and food Y, which contains 300 grams in total.\n2. Food X contains 10% protein, so for every 100 grams of food X, there are 10 grams of protein.\n3. Similarly, food Y contains 15% protein, so for every 100 grams of food Y, there are 15 grams of protein.\n4. The rabbit's diet provides exactly 39 grams of protein daily, and this is made up of a mixture of food X and food Y.\n5. Let x be the number of grams of food X in the mixture, and let y be the number of grams of food Y in the mixture. We know that x + y = 300 (since there are 300 grams of the mixture in total).\n6. Since food X contains 10% protein, the amount of protein from food X is 0.1x.\n7. Similarly, since food Y contains 15% protein, the amount of protein from food Y is 0.15y.\n8. We know that the total amount of protein in the diet is 39 grams, so we can set up the equation: 0.1x + 0.15y = 39.\n9. Since x + y = 300, we can express y as 300 - x and substitute this into the second equation: 0.1x + 0.15(300 - x) = 39.\n10. Expanding and simplifying the equation gives us: 0.1x + 45 - 0.15x = 39.\n11. Combining like terms, we get: -0.05x + 45 = 39.\n12. Subtracting 45 from both sides gives us: -0.05x = -6.\n13. Dividing by -0.05, we find that x = 120.\n\nSo, there are 120 grams of food X in the mixture."}

Since a certain number of men can do a work in 20 days, we can say that the total amount of work done by the men is proportional to the product of the number of men and the number of days they worked. Therefore, we can write an equation: Work = kx \\* 20, where k is a constant.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the situation when there are 4 more men added to the original group of x men. The total number of men now becomes (x + 4).\n\n4. According to the problem statement, with the additional 4 men, the work can be completed in 5 days less than before.

The difference in speed is 45 - 36 = 9 kmph.\n\nStep 2: Convert the difference in speed from kmph to minutes per hour.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the speed difference into minutes by dividing by the train's normal hourly distance it could have traveled if it didn't stop. Let's assume x as the total time for which the train runs without stopping (speed excluding stoppages). The speed of the train excluding stoppages is 45 kmph and including stoppages is 36 kmph.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the actual time spent by the train on running in an hour.\nThe actual time spent by the train while running, i.e., not stopping is (45/100) * 60 = 27 minutes. The difference between the maximum speed and minimum speed of the train can be calculated as: (45 - 36) * (1/45) * 60.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the actual time spent by the train on stopping in an hour.\nNow, let's calculate how long it takes for the train to cover the distance that would have been covered at its full speed if there were no stoppages. This will be calculated as: (9/45) * 60 = (1/5) * 60 = 12 minutes.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the actual time spent by the train on stopping in an hour.\nNow, we know that the total number of minutes for which the train runs without stopping is 27 minutes and it stops for x - 27 minutes. Hence, to find out how many minutes does the train stop per hour, we need to subtract the total running time from the total time.\n\nStep 6: Finally calculate the actual time spent by the train on stopping in an hour.\nTotal running time = Total time per hour - Stopping time per hour\n= 60 - 12\n= 48 minutes\n\nStep 7: So, we can conclude that the train stops for 12 minutes every hour."}

The remaining 5 friends plus another friend will occupy the next 6 seats.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of possible arrangements for these 6 people:\n\nSince there are 6! ways to arrange n distinct objects in a row, we have 6! possibilities to arrange these 6 people around Williams and one other friend.\n\nHowever, within this unit (the pair consisting of Williams and one friend), there can be two different arrangements: either Williams is on the left or he's on the right. This introduces an extra factor of 2 in our total count of possible arrangements.\n\nHence, we have a total of 6! x 2 = 1440 ways to arrange these seven friends under this condition."}

{"text": "Q: Scott's average (arithmetic mean) golf score on his first four rounds was 18.What score does he need on his fifth round to drop his average score by 2 points?\nA: Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The average score of Scott's first four rounds is 18. This means that the total score of these four rounds is 4 x 18 = 72.\n\n2. To drop his average score by 2 points, Scott needs to have a lower total score after five rounds. Let's call the score on the fifth round 'x'. The new total score will be 72 + x.\n\n3. Since Scott wants to drop his average score by 2 points, the new average score should be 18 - 2 = 16. This means that the new total score (72 + x) divided by 5 should equal 16.\n\n4. We can set up an equation based on this: (72 + x) / 5 = 16.\n\n5. To solve for 'x', we first multiply both sides of the equation by 5 to get rid of the fraction: 72 + x = 80.\n\n6. Now, let's isolate 'x' by subtracting 72 from both sides: x = 8.\n\nTherefore, Scott needs a score of 8 on his fifth round to drop his average score by 2 points."}

The speed of the train is?\nA: To find the speed of the train, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the relative speed of the train with respect to the man.\n\nThe distance covered by the train while passing the man is equal to its own length, which is 125 m. This distance is covered in 10 seconds. To calculate the speed of the train relative to the man, we can use the formula:\n\nRelative speed = Distance / Time\n= 125 m / 10 sec\n= 12.5 m/sec\n\nStep 2: Convert the relative speed from meters per second to kilometers per hour.\n\n1 km/hr = (1000 m) / (3600 sec)\nSo, 1 m/sec ≈ 3.6 km/hr\n\nRelative speed = 12.5 m/sec * 3.6 km/hr/m/sec\n= 45 km/hr\n\nStep 3: Calculate the actual speed of the train.\n\nLet's denote the speed of the train as 'T' and the speed of the man as 'M'. Since they are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is equal to the difference between their speeds:\n\nRelative speed = T - M\n= 45 km/hr\n\nWe know that the speed of the man is 11 km/hr. Therefore:\n\nT - 11 = 45\n\nStep 4: Solve for 'T'.\n\nT = 45 + 11\n= 56 km/hr\n\nSo, the speed of the train is 56 km/hr."}

A dog takes 5 leaps for every 8 leaps of a hare. This means that the ratio of the number of leaps taken by the dog to the number of leaps taken by the hare is 5:8.\n\n2. One leap of the dog is equal to 5 leaps of the hare. This implies that if we consider the distance covered in one leap, the dog covers 5 times more distance than the hare does in one leap.\n\n3. To find the ratio of their speeds, we need to compare the distances they cover in a given time period.\n\nLet's assume the speed of the hare is x meters per second (m/s). Then, the distance covered by the hare in one leap is 5x/8 m.\n\nSimilarly, since one leap of the dog covers 5 times more distance than one leap of the hare, the speed of the dog is 5x m/s. The distance covered by the dog in one leap is also 5x m.\n\n4. Now, we want to find the ratio of their speeds. We can do this by comparing the distances they cover in a given time period (let's say 1 second).\n\nSince the speed of the hare is x m/s, it covers x meters in 1 second. Since one leap of the hare is equal to 5x/8 meters, the dog will cover the same distance as the hare (i.e., x meters) by taking 5 leaps.\n\nThe ratio of their speeds is thus the number of leaps taken by the dog divided by the number of leaps taken by the hare, multiplied by the speed of the dog divided by the speed of the hare:\n\n(5 / 8) × (5x / x) = 25/8\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the speed of the dog to that of the hare is 25:8."}

To convert this to meters, we divide by 100:\nDepth = 1 cm ÷ 100 = 0.01 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the volume of water displaced:\nVolume = Area × Depth\n= 14 m² × 0.01 m\n= 0.14 m³\n\nThe density of water is approximately 1000 kg/m³. We can use this to find the mass of water displaced by the boat when the man gets on it:\nMass of water displaced = Density of water × Volume of water displaced\n= 1000 kg/m³ × 0.14 m³\n= 140 kg\n\nSince the mass of the man is equal to the mass of water displaced, we can conclude that the mass of the man is 140 kg."}
{"text": "Q: A cistern can be filled by a tap in 6 hours while it can be emptied by another tap in 12 hours. If both the taps are opened simultaneously, then after how much time will the cistern get filled?\nA: Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. The first tap can fill the cistern in 6 hours, which means it fills 1/6 of the cistern in one hour.\n2. The second tap can empty the cistern in 12 hours, which means it empties 1/12 of the cistern in one hour.\n3. When both taps are opened simultaneously, their rates of filling and emptying the cistern add up. So, the net rate at which the cistern is being filled is (1/6 - 1/12) per hour.\n4. To find the common denominator, we can convert 1/6 to 2/12 and 1/12 remains as it is. So, the net rate becomes (2/12 - 1/12) = 1/12 per hour.\n5. This means that together, the taps fill 1/12 of the cistern in one hour.\n6. Since the first tap alone can fill the entire cistern in 6 hours, and now it's being helped by the second tap which adds to its rate, we need to find how much time it will take for both taps working together to fill the cistern.\n\nThe formula to calculate the combined rate is: (Rate of filling + Rate of emptying) = Combined rate.\n\nHere, the combined rate is 1/6 (rate of filling by tap 1) - 1/12 (rate of emptying by tap 2) per hour.\n\nSince we already calculated that their combined rate is 1/12 per hour, we need to find how long it takes for the combined rate of 1/12 to fill the cistern. Since it's a simple inverse relationship, if the first tap can fill the cistern in 6 hours (which means its filling rate is 1/6), and when both taps work together their net rate is 1/12 per hour, we simply multiply the time taken by the individual rate of the slower tap to get the time taken by the combined rates.\n\nHence, it will take 6 * 2 = 12 hours for the cistern to be filled completely with both taps working together."}
{"text": "Q: A salesperson receives a base salary of $1000 per month and a commission of 7.5% of the selling price of each item sold above the first 50 item. If this month she sold 370 items for $150 each, what will her monthly salary be?\nA: To find the salesperson's total monthly salary, we need to calculate the commission earned and add it to the base salary.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many items were sold above the first 50 items. Total items sold = 370, First 50 items = 50\nItems sold above 50 = 370 - 50 = 320\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total sales made from these 320 items.\nPrice per item = $150\nTotal sales = Price per item * Number of items sold\n= 150 * 320\n= $48,000\n\nSince the commission is 7.5% of the selling price above the first 50 items, we need to calculate the commission earned from these 320 items.\nCommission = 7.5% of $48,000\n= (7.5/100) * 48000\n= 3600\n\nNow, let's add the base salary and the commission to find the total monthly salary.\nTotal monthly salary = Base salary + Commission\n= $1000 + $3600\n= $4600\n\nTherefore, the salesperson's monthly salary will be $4600."}

{"text": "Q: How many 4-letter word with or without meaning can be formed out of the letters of the word 'LOGARITHMS' if repetition of letters is not allowed\nA: To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to form a 4-letter word using the letters of the word \"LOGARITHMS\" without allowing repetition of letters.\n\nFirst, let's count the total number of unique letters in the word \"LOGARITHMS\". The letters are L, O, G, A, R, I, T, H, M, and S. There are 10 unique letters.\n\nSince we want to form a 4-letter word without repetition, we can choose any 4 letters out of the 10 unique letters. This is a combination problem, and we can calculate it as follows:\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!)\n= 10! / (4!6!)\n= (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6!) / (4!6!)\n= (10 × 9 × 8 × 7) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n= 5040 / 24\n= 210\n\nSo, there are 210 ways to choose the 4 letters for our word.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of arrangements of these 4 letters. Since repetition is not allowed and the order matters (because it's a word), this is a permutation problem. We can calculate it as follows:\n\nP(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!)\n= 10! / (4!6!)\n(same calculation as above)\n\nHowever, we are choosing 4 letters out of the 10 unique letters, and then arranging them in different ways. We can also think of it this way: for each choice of 4 letters, there are 4! = 24 ways to arrange them.\n\nSo, the total number of arrangements is the product of the number of choices (210) and the number of arrangements per choice (24):\n\nTotal arrangements = 210 × 24\n= 5040\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 5040 different 4-letter words that can be formed out of the letters of the word \"LOGARITHMS\" without allowing repetition of letters."}
{"text": "Q: In an election between two candidates, the winner has a margin of 20% of the votes polled. If 3000 people change their mind and vote for the loser, the loser would have won by a margin of 20% of the votes polled. Find the total number of votes polled in the election?\nA: Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The winner has a margin of 20% of the votes polled, which means that if x is the total number of votes polled, then the difference between the votes for the winner and the loser is 0.2x.\n2. If 3000 people change their mind and vote for the loser, the loser would have won by a margin of 20% of the votes polled, which means that the difference between the votes for the loser and the winner would be -0.2(x-3000).\n3. Since the absolute value of the difference is the same in both cases (because it's a margin), we can set up an equation: |0.2x| = |-0.2(x-3000)|.\n4. Simplifying the equation, we get 0.2|x| = -0.2(x-3000).\n5. Dividing both sides by -0.2 (and remembering that x is a positive number because it's a count of votes), we get |x| = x - 15000.\n6. Now, since the absolute value of x is just x itself in this case (because x is already a positive number), we can simplify further: x = x - 15000.\n7. Subtracting x from both sides gives us 0 = -15000.\n8. This equation doesn't make sense because it implies that something can be equal to zero and also be a negative value at the same time, which is a logical contradiction.\n\nHowever, we know that votes are always positive numbers. Therefore, let's look at our steps again. In step 4, we said |0.2x| = |-0.2(x-3000)|. This equation should have x as its solution because it represents the total number of votes polled in both cases.\n\nConsidering this, let's correct our approach:\n\nWe can simplify the equation |0.2x| = |-0.2(x-3000)| to get 0.2|x| = 0.2(x - 15000).\n\nNow, we divide both sides by 0.2 (which is positive), so it doesn't affect the direction of the inequality:\n\n|x| = x - 15000\n\nThis equation still has a logical contradiction because x cannot be equal to itself minus 15000 and also not be zero.\n\nHowever, looking at this from a different perspective: we know that if there are x votes for the winner, then (x - 0.2x) votes are actually votes for the loser in the first case. If 3000 people switch sides, then (x-3000 - 0.2(x - 3000)) = (x - 15000) would be votes for the winner.\n\nGiven this information, let's recalculate the number of votes polled using a new perspective:\n\nLet x be the total number of votes polled in the election initially.\n\nInitially, votes for the winner: x\nvotes for the loser: x - 0.2x = 0.8x\n\nNow, if 3000 people switch sides and vote for the loser, then:\nvotes for the loser are now (0.8x + 3000)\n\nGiven that this would result in a 20% margin of votes polled for the winner:\n\n(x - (0.8x + 3000)) = 0.2(x) \n\nThis equation simplifies to: \n(-0.2x + 3000) = 0.2(x)\n-0.4x + 6000 = 0\n-0.4x = -6000\n\nDividing by -0.4:\n\nx = 15000\n\nSo the total number of votes polled in the election initially is indeed 15000."}

If the 200-mile trip took 3 hours less than the 350-mile trip, what was the average speed, in miles per hour?\nA: To find the average speed of Louisa's travel on both days, we need to first determine her average speed for each day.\n\nLet's denote the average speed for the 200-mile trip as x miles per hour. Since she traveled at the same average speed on the second day, her average speed for the 350-mile trip is also x miles per hour.\n\nWe know that the time it takes to travel a certain distance at a constant speed is given by the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nFor the 200-mile trip:\nTime_1 = 200 / x\n\nFor the 350-mile trip:\nTime_2 = 350 / x\n\nIt's also given that Time_1 - Time_2 = 3 hours.\n\nSubstituting the formulas for Time_1 and Time_2:\n\n(200 / x) - (350 / x) = 3\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n(-150 / x) = 3\n\nMultiplying both sides by x to eliminate the denominator:\n\n-150 = 3x\n\nDividing both sides by 3 to solve for x:\n\nx = -50\n\nHowever, speed cannot be negative. This indicates that our initial assumption about which trip took longer is incorrect.\n\nLet's reconsider: if Time_2 - Time_1 = 3 hours, then the 350-mile trip took 3 hours more than the 200-mile trip.\n\nFor the 200-mile trip:\nTime_1 = 200 / x\n\nFor the 350-mile trip:\nTime_2 = 350 / x\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n(350 / x) - (200 / x) = 3\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n(150 / x) = 3\n\nMultiplying both sides by x to eliminate the denominator:\n\n150 = 3x\n\nDividing both sides by 3 to solve for x:\n\nx = 50\n\nSo, Louisa's average speed was 50 miles per hour."}

So, the distance covered by the train in crossing the electric pole is equal to its own length, which is 200 m.\n\nStep 2: The time taken by the train to cross the electric pole is given as 5 sec.\n\nStep 3: We know that speed = distance / time.

If the company’s average revenue per customer per month is $100, then what percent of the company's revenue comes from customers with Plan A?\nA: To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: Let's assume that the number of customers subscribing to Plan A is x and the number of customers subscribing to Plan B is y. We know that the total number of customers (x + y) multiplied by $100 (average revenue per customer per month) equals the total revenue for all customers, which can be expressed as $25x + $75y.\n\nStep 2: The equation from Step 1 is:\n$100(x + y) = $25x + $75y\nThis simplifies to:\n$100x + $100y = $25x + $75y\n\nStep 3: To solve for x in terms of y, we can rearrange the equation by subtracting $25x and adding $75y to both sides. This yields:\n$75x = -$25y\n$x = -\\frac{25}{75}y$\nSimplifying gives us:\n$x = -\\frac{1}{3}y$\n\nStep 4: To find the ratio of customers subscribing to Plan A (x) to the total number of customers (x + y), we can substitute $-\\frac{1}{3}y$ for x in the expression (x + y). This gives us:\nTotal Customers = $-\\frac{1}{3}y$ + y\nSimplifying yields:\nTotal Customers = $\\frac{2}{3}y$\n\nStep 5: The ratio of customers subscribing to Plan A is then given by the number of Plan A subscribers (x) divided by the total number of customers. Substituting $-\\frac{1}{3}y$ for x, we have:\n$\\frac{x}{Total Customers}$ = $\\frac{-\\frac{1}{3}y}{\\frac{2}{3}y}$\nSimplifying this expression gives us:\n$\\frac{x}{Total Customers}$ = $-\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nStep 6: However, the negative sign is irrelevant in this context. We are interested in the percentage of customers subscribing to Plan A out of the total, so we take the absolute value of our ratio.\n\nTo convert this ratio into a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n$\\left(\\frac{x}{Total Customers}\\right) * 100 = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)*100$\n\nSimplifying yields:\n\n-50%\n\nSince percentages cannot be negative, and the problem is asking for the percent of revenue coming from customers with Plan A, we have misunderstood our calculation. The correct approach should consider that if x represents the number of customers on plan A, then y represents the customers on plan B.\n\nStep 7: Let’s re-evaluate Step 5 considering that a negative ratio doesn't apply here:\nWe take the absolute value of $\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ which is $\\frac{1}{2}$ and convert it into percentage by multiplying with 100.\n\nThe final answer is:"}

Then, (200 - x) will be the number of gallons of fuel B added.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the amount of ethanol in fuel A and fuel B.\nFuel A contains 12% ethanol by volume, so the amount of ethanol in fuel A is 0.12x gallons.\nFuel B contains 16% ethanol by volume, so the amount of ethanol in fuel B is 0.16(200 - x) gallons.\n\nStep 3: Set up an equation based on the total amount of ethanol in the full tank.\nThe sum of the ethanol in fuel A and fuel B equals the total amount of ethanol in the full tank, which is given as 30 gallons.

{"text": "Q: Daniel went to a shop and bought things worth Rs. 25, out of which 30 Paise went on sales tax on taxable purchases. If the tax rate was 5%, then what was the cost of the tax free items?\nA: To find the cost of the tax-free items, let's first calculate the total value of the taxable purchases.\n\nLet's denote the cost of the taxable purchases as x. Since the sales tax on these purchases is 30 paise (which is equal to Rs. 0.30), we can use the tax rate formula:\n\nTax = Tax Rate × Cost of Taxable Purchases\n\nGiven that the tax rate is 5% and the tax amount is Rs. 0.30, we can set up the equation as follows:\n\n0.30 = (5/100) × x\n\nTo find x, multiply both sides by 100 and divide by 5:\n\nx = 0.30 × 100 / 5\nx = 6\n\nSo, the cost of the taxable purchases is Rs. 6.\n\nNow, let's find the total value of all items purchased (which includes both tax-free and taxable items). We know that Daniel spent a total of Rs. 25 on everything. Out of this amount, the cost of the tax-free items can be found by subtracting the sum of the tax and the cost of the taxable purchases from the total.\n\nCost of Tax-Free Items = Total Cost - (Tax + Cost of Taxable Purchases)\n= 25 - (0.30 + 6)\n\nFirst, convert Rs. 0.30 to whole numbers:\n0.30 = 30 paise = Rs. 0.30\n\nThen subtract the tax amount and the cost of taxable purchases from the total cost:\n\nCost of Tax-Free Items = 25 - 36.3 (after converting 0.30 to Rs.)\n= -11.3\n\nThis calculation is incorrect because we cannot have a negative value for the cost of items.\n\nRecalculate the cost of tax-free items by adding the tax and cost of taxable purchases in rupees:\n\nTax = 30 paise = Rs. 0.30\nCost of Taxable Purchases = Rs. 6\n\nSo, when adding these values together, we should get:\nTotal Cost of Tax-Free Items = Total Amount - (Tax + Cost of Taxable Purchases)\n= 25 - (0.30 + 6)\n\nFirst, add the tax amount and cost of taxable purchases:\n0.30 + 6 = 6.30\n\nThen subtract this sum from the total cost:\n\nCost of Tax-Free Items = 25 - 6.3\n= 18.7\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with a currency that only accepts whole numbers (paise) for small amounts, it's more accurate to represent these values in terms of paise.\n\nLet's convert this value back into rupees:\nCost of Tax-Free Items = 25 - 6.3\n= 18.7\n\nConverting the tax amount and cost of taxable purchases from rupees to paise for easier calculation:\nTax = Rs. 0.30 = 30 paise\nCost of Taxable Purchases = Rs. 6 = 600 paise\n\nNow calculate the total value in paise:\nTotal Value in Paise = Total Cost × 100 (since we're dealing with rupees and want to convert everything into paise for easier calculation)\n= 25 × 100\n= 2500 paise\n\nNext, subtract the sum of tax amount and cost of taxable purchases from this total:\n\nCost of Tax-Free Items in Paise = Total Value - (Tax + Cost of Taxable Purchases)\n= 2500 - (30 + 600)\n\nSimplify inside the parentheses:\nTotal Value in Paise - (Tax + Cost of Taxable Purchases) \n= 2500 - 630\n= 1870\n\nTo convert this back into rupees, divide by 100:\nCost of Tax-Free Items = 1870 / 100\n= Rs. 18.70\n\nSo, the cost of tax-free items is approximately Rs. 18.70."}

Machine B produces 10% more sprockets per hour than machine A. How many sprockets per hour does machineAproduce?\nA: Let's denote the number of sprockets that machine B produces per hour as x. Since it takes machine A 10 hours longer to produce 330 sprockets, we can set up an equation based on their production rates.\n\nMachine B produces x sprockets per hour, so in 330/x hours, it will produce 330 sprockets.\nSimilarly, Machine A produces (0.9x) sprockets per hour (10% less than machine B), and in the time that takes machine B to produce 330 sprockets (i.e., 330/x hours) it will have produced a total of 330/x * (0.9x).\n\nSince both machines produce 330 sprockets, we can equate their production:\n(330 / x) = ((330 / x) * 0.9)\n\nMultiplying both sides by x to get rid of the denominator gives us:\n330 = 297\n\nThis equation doesn't make sense because it's saying that 330 is equal to 297. This means our assumption about the time taken by machine A was incorrect, and we need to consider a different approach.\n\nLet's denote the time taken by machine B as y hours. Then machine A takes y + 10 hours.\nWe know that machine B produces 10% more sprockets per hour than machine A. This means machine B produces x = 1.1 * (330/y) sprockets per hour.\n\nMachine A, which produces less sprockets per hour, will take longer to produce the same number of sprockets (330), and its production rate is therefore:\n(330 / (y + 10))\n\nSince we know that machine B takes y hours, it's also true that it can make 330 sprockets in y hours. So its production rate per hour is indeed x = 330/y.\n\nEquating the two expressions for machine A's and B's production rates gives us:\n(330 / (y + 10)) = (330/y) * 0.9\n\nMultiplying both sides by (y + 10)y to eliminate the denominators, we get:\n\n330y = 297(y + 10)\n\nExpanding the equation on the right-hand side and combining like terms gives us:\n330y = 297y + 2970\n\nSubtracting 297y from both sides results in:\n33y = 2970\n\nDividing both sides by 33, we get:\n\ny = 90\n\nSo machine B takes 90 hours to make 330 sprockets.\n\nNow that we have the time taken by machine B (y), we can find its production rate per hour. This is simply:\nx = 330 / y = 330 / 90 = 3.67\n\nSince machine A produces 10% less than machine B, its production rate per hour is:\n0.9 * x = 0.9 * 3.67 = 3.3\n\nThe answer to the question of how many sprockets per hour does machine A produce?"}

So we can rewrite this as:\n\n(4)^m = (4^1) × (4^(-m))\n\nSince the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:\n\nm = -m + 1\n\nAdd m to both sides of the equation:\n\n2m = 1\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nm = 1/2\n\nHowever, since m is an integer and the question specifies that m must be an integer, our solution doesn't satisfy this requirement.

How many of these machines, working simultaneously and independently at this constant rate, can produce a total of 5x units of product P in 6 days?\nA: To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: Understand the given information.\nWe are told that 6 machines can produce x units of product P in 10 days. This means that together, these 6 machines have a combined production rate that allows them to complete 0.1x units per day (since they work for 10 days and produce x units).\n\nStep 2: Determine the production rate of one machine.\nSince there are 6 machines working simultaneously and independently at an identical constant rate, we can calculate the daily production rate of one machine by dividing the combined production rate by the number of machines. This gives us a production rate of (0.1x)/6 units per day for each individual machine.\n\nStep 3: Calculate how many machines are needed to produce 5x units in 6 days.\nWe need to find out how many machines, working simultaneously and independently at this constant rate, can produce a total of 5x units of product P in 6 days. To do this, we first determine the daily production target: 5x units divided by 6 days equals (5/6)x units per day.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the required number of machines.\nWe know that each machine produces (0.1x)/6 units per day. We need to find out how many machines are needed to produce (5/6)x units per day, so we divide this production target by the daily output of one machine:\n\n[(5/6)x] / [(0.1x)/6] = [(5/6) * 6] / (0.1x) = 5 / 0.1 = 50\n\nThis means that we need 50 machines working simultaneously and independently at this constant rate to produce a total of 5x units in 6 days."}

If her total sales for pairs of contact lenses last week were $1,455, what was the total number of pairs of contact lenses that she sold?\nA: Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nStep 1: Define variables\nLet x be the number of pairs of hard contact lenses sold.\nSince 5 more pairs of soft lenses were sold than hard lenses, the number of pairs of soft contact lenses sold is x + 5.\n\nStep 2: Calculate total sales for each type of lens\nThe total sales for hard contact lenses are $85x.\nThe total sales for soft contact lenses are $150(x + 5).\n\nStep 3: Set up an equation based on the total sales\nSince the total sales for pairs of contact lenses were $1,455, we can set up the following equation:\n\n85x + 150(x + 5) = 1455\n\nStep 4: Expand and simplify the equation\nExpanding the equation gives us:\n85x + 150x + 750 = 1455\n\nCombining like terms yields:\n235x + 750 = 1455\n\nSubtracting 750 from both sides of the equation results in:\n\n235x = 705\n\nStep 5: Solve for x\nDividing both sides of the equation by 235 gives us:\n\nx = 3\n\nNow that we have found the value of x, which represents the number of pairs of hard contact lenses sold, we can find the total number of pairs of contact lenses sold.\n\nStep 6: Find the total number of pairs of contact lenses sold\nThe total number of pairs of contact lenses sold is the sum of the number of pairs of soft lenses and hard lenses:\n\nTotal = (x + 5) + x\n\nSubstituting the value of x into this equation gives us:\n\nTotal = (3 + 5) + 3\n= 8 + 3\n= 11\n\nTherefore, the total number of pairs of contact lenses that she sold is 11."}
{"text": "Q: A number when divided by 221 gives a remainder 43, what remainder will be obtained by dividing the same number 17?\nA: To solve this problem, we need to understand how remainders work when numbers are divided.\n\n1. First, let's consider the initial situation: a number (let's call it 'x') divided by 221 gives a remainder of 43. This can be represented as:\n\n   x = 221q + 43\n\n   where q is the quotient and 'x' is the dividend.\n\n2. Now, we need to find what happens when this same number 'x' is divided by 17. To do that, let's look at our equation from step 1.\n\n3. Since we are trying to understand how a number behaves in division by different divisors (in this case, going from divisor 221 to divisor 17), we need to see what happens when you divide the entire expression (x = 221q + 43) by 17.\n\n4. Dividing the entire equation by 17:\n\n   x / 17 = (221q + 43) / 17\n\n5. When dividing the sum of two numbers, we can separate them and then divide each term individually if they share a common divisor.\n\n6. The number 221 is divisible by 17 because 221 = 13 * 17. Hence:\n\n   (221q) / 17 = q (since 221q becomes 17q when divided by 17)\n\n7. Now, let's look at the second term in our division (43 / 17). This will give us the remainder we're looking for.\n\n8. Since 43 is not divisible by 17, it will be a non-zero, whole number quotient with some remainder. To find this remainder, you divide 43 by 17:\n\n   43 / 17 = 2.529 (approximately)\n\n9. Multiplying this result by 17 gives the part of 'x' that's exactly divisible by 17. This leaves us with a remainder from the division of 43 by 17.\n\n10. Since we're only interested in the remainder and not the quotient itself, let's calculate it directly:\n\n    The remainder when 43 is divided by 17 is 43 - (2 * 17) = 43 - 34 = 9.\n\nTherefore, the remainder obtained by dividing the same number by 17 will be 9."}

So, the total markings for the 1/3 portion are 5 (including the endpoints).\n\nFor the 1/4 portion, there will be 4 equal parts. Similar to the previous case, there will be 3 markings within these 4 parts (excluding the endpoints), as one end is already counted. So, the total markings for the 1/4 portion are also 5.\n\nSince the stick has both a 1/3 and a 1/4 marking, we need to account for the overlap between them. The 1/3 portion marks off one of its segments (the larger segment) into four equal parts, which aligns with the 1/4 markings. This means there are three additional markings within this shared section.\n\nTo find the total number of markings on the entire stick, we add the markings for the 1/3 and 1/4 portions together, then subtract the overlap to avoid double-counting:\n\nMarkings for 1/3 portion: 5\nMarkings for 1/4 portion: 5\nOverlap (shared markings): 3\n\nTotal markings = 5 + 5 - 3 = 7\n\nTherefore, there will be a total of 7 markings on the stick."}

{"text": "Q: A girl has exactly 5 quarters, 9 dimes, and 10 nickels in her pocket. If she withdraws a number of these coins at random, how many coins would she have to withdraw to ensure that she has at least a 50 percent chance of withdrawing at least one quarter?\nA: To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of coins that the girl must withdraw to guarantee that she will have at least a 50% chance of getting at least one quarter.\n\nLet's denote the total number of coins as n. We know that there are 5 quarters, 9 dimes, and 10 nickels, so the total number of coins is:\n\nn = 5 (quarters) + 9 (dimes) + 10 (nickels)\n= 24\n\nNow, we want to find the minimum value of n such that the probability of getting at least one quarter is greater than or equal to 0.5.\n\nLet's assume that she withdraws x coins. The number of ways to get no quarters is the same as choosing x coins from the remaining 19 coins (non-quarters), which is:\n\nC(19, x)\n\nThe total number of ways to choose x coins out of n = 24 coins is:\n\nC(n, x) = C(24, x)\n\nWe want to find the minimum value of n such that the probability of getting at least one quarter is greater than or equal to 0.5. This can be represented as:\n\n1 - P(no quarters) ≥ 0.5\n\nP(no quarters) = (Number of ways to choose no quarters)/(Total number of ways)\n= C(19, x)/C(24, x)\n\nWe want to find the minimum value of n such that:\n\n1 - C(19, x)/C(24, x) ≥ 0.5\n\nSimplifying the inequality:\n\nP(no quarters) ≤ 0.5\nC(19, x)/C(24, x) ≤ 0.5\n\nTo find the minimum value of n, we can try different values of x and calculate the corresponding probabilities.\n\nLet's start with x = 1:\n\nC(19, 1)/C(24, 1) ≈ 0.208 (less than 0.5)\n\nThis means that if she withdraws only 1 coin, there is less than a 50% chance of getting no quarters, which guarantees that she will get at least one quarter.\n\nHowever, this contradicts the fact that we want to find the minimum number of coins to guarantee at least one quarter.\n\nLet's try x = 2:\n\nC(19, 2)/C(24, 2) ≈ 0.416 (greater than 0.5)\n\nThis means that if she withdraws 2 coins, there is more than a 50% chance of getting no quarters.\n\nHowever, this guarantees that she will get at least one quarter if she withdraws 3 coins.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of coins that the girl must withdraw to guarantee that she will have at least a 50% chance of getting at least one quarter is 3."}

What is the length of the field?\nA: To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: Define the width and length of the rectangular field.\nLet's say the width of the field is x meters. Since the length is double its width, the length of the field is 2x meters.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the area of the square pond.\nThe area of a square is given by the formula: side × side = side^2\nHere, the side of the square pond is 6 meters. So, the area of the pond is 6 × 6 = 36 square meters.\n\nStep 3: Determine the total area of the rectangular field.\nSince the area of the pond is 1/8 of the area of the field, we can calculate the area of the field by multiplying the area of the pond by 8.\nArea of the field = Area of the pond × 8\n= 36 × 8\n= 288 square meters\n\nStep 4: Use the width and length to express the total area of the rectangular field.\nThe formula for the area of a rectangle is given by: length × width\nHere, we have already defined the length as 2x meters and the width as x meters.

This can be expressed as:\n\nA_sq = A_rect + (108 1/3)% * A_rect\nd^2 = ab + (108 1/3)% * ab\n\nStep 5: To simplify the expression, let's convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100 and adding it to 1:\n\n(108 1/3)% = 108 1/3/100 ≈ 1.083\nA_sq ≈ A_rect + 1.083 * A_rect\nd^2 ≈ 2.083ab\n\nStep 6: We can rewrite d^2 as (a + b)^2 - 2ab, using the fact that a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab:\n\n(a + b)^2 - 2ab ≈ 2.083ab\n(a + b)^2 - 2ab = 2.083ab\n\nStep 7: Substitute a + b = 14 from Step 3 into the equation above:\n\n(14)^2 - 2ab = 2.083ab\n196 - 2ab = 2.083ab\n\nStep 8: Rearrange the terms to isolate ab on one side of the equation:\n\n-2ab - 2.083ab = -196\n-4.083ab = -196\n\nStep 9: Now, divide both sides by -4.083 to solve for ab:\n\nab ≈ -196 / (-4.083)\nab ≈ 48\n\nStep 10: Since a + b = 14 (from Step 3), and we have found that ab ≈ 48, we can now find the difference between the sides of the rectangle.\n\nLet's express this as a quadratic equation in terms of a:\n\na^2 - 14a + 48 = 0\n\nStep 11: To solve for a, let's use the quadratic formula:\n\na = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -14, and c = 48. We will consider the positive root.\n\nSubstituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\na ≈ (-(-14) + √((-14)^2 - 4(1)(48))) / (2*1)\na ≈ (14 + √(196 - 192)) / 2\na ≈ (14 + √4) / 2\na ≈ (14 + 2) / 2\n\nStep 12: Simplify the expression to find a:\n\na ≈ 16/2\na ≈ 8\n\nNow, since we know that a + b = 14 and a ≈ 8, we can find b by rearranging this equation:\n\nb ≈ 14 - a\nb ≈ 14 - 8\nb ≈ 6\n\nStep 13: Finally, we need to find the difference between the sides of the rectangle. This is simply the absolute difference between a and b.\n\n|a - b| = |8 - 6|\n|a - b| = 2\n\nTherefore, the difference between the sides of the rectangle is 2 units."}
{"text": "Q: The price of a jacket is reduced by 25%. During a special sale the price of the jacket is reduced another 10%. By approximately what percent must the price of the jacket now be increased in order to restore it to its original amount?\nA: Let's assume the original price of the jacket is $100.\n\nStep 1: The price of the jacket is reduced by 25%.\n\nPrice after first reduction = $100 - (25% of $100)\n= $100 - $25\n= $75\n\nStep 2: During a special sale, the price of the jacket is reduced another 10%.\n\nPrice after second reduction = $75 - (10% of $75)\n= $75 - $7.50\n= $67.50\n\nStep 3: We need to find the percentage by which the price must be increased to restore it to its original amount.\n\nLet x be the percentage increase needed.\n\nThen, the new price after the increase will be:\n\nNew Price = $67.50 + (x% of $67.50)\n= $67.50 + ($67.50 * x/100)\n\nWe want this new price to be equal to the original price of $100.\n\n$67.50 + ($67.50 * x/100) = $100\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\n$67.50 * x/100 = $32.50\nx/100 = $32.50 / $67.50\nx ≈ 0.48 (rounding to two decimal places)\n\nTo find the percentage increase, multiply x by 100:\n\nPercentage Increase ≈ 0.48 × 100\n≈ 48%\n\nTherefore, the price of the jacket must be increased by approximately 48% to restore it to its original amount."}

{"text": "Q: The average speed of a car decreased by 3 miles per hour every successive 8-minutes interval. If the car traveled 4.4 miles in the fifth 8-minute interval, what was the average speed of the car, in miles per hour, in the first 8 minute interval?\nA: To solve this problem, we need to work backwards and calculate the speed of the car for each 8-minute interval.\n\nGiven that the car traveled 4.4 miles in the fifth 8-minute interval, we can calculate its average speed for this interval as follows:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Time\n= 4.4 miles / (8 minutes * 1 hour / 60 minutes)\n= 4.4 miles / (0.1333 hours)\n≈ 33 mph\n\nNow that we know the speed of the car in the fifth interval, we can calculate its speed for the fourth interval, which is 3 mph faster than the fifth interval:\n\nSpeed of the car in the fourth interval = Speed of the car in the fifth interval + 3 mph\n= 33 mph + 3 mph\n= 36 mph\n\nSimilarly, we can calculate the speed of the car for the third, second, and first intervals as follows:\n\nSpeed of the car in the third interval = Speed of the car in the fourth interval + 3 mph\n= 36 mph + 3 mph\n= 39 mph\n\nSpeed of the car in the second interval = Speed of the car in the third interval + 3 mph\n= 39 mph + 3 mph\n= 42 mph\n\nSpeed of the car in the first interval = Speed of the car in the second interval + 3 mph\n= 42 mph + 3 mph\n= 45 mph\n\nTherefore, the average speed of the car in the first 8-minute interval was 45 miles per hour."}

If the area of each sector of the graph is proportional to the percent of the budget it represents, how many degrees of the circle are used to represent transportation?\nA: Step 1: Calculate the total percentage of the budget that has been allocated to salaries, research and development, utilities, equipment, and supplies.\nTotal allocated = 55 + 9 + 5 + 4 + 2 = 75%\n\nStep 2: Since the remainder is for transportation, calculate the percentage left for transportation by subtracting the total allocated from 100%.\nTransportation percentage = 100% - 75% = 25%\n\nStep 3: A full circle has 360 degrees. To find out how many degrees represent transportation, calculate the percentage of the budget used for transportation as a fraction of the total and multiply it by the total number of degrees in a circle.\nDegrees for transportation = (Transportation percentage / 100) * 360\n\nStep 4: Perform the calculation to determine the degrees for transportation.\nDegrees for transportation = (25/100) * 360\n= 0.25 * 360\n= 90"}
{"text": "Q: If the area of a square with sides of length 4 centimeters is equal to the area of a rectangle with a width of 8 centimeters, what is the length of the rectangle, in centimeters?\nA: Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the area of the square.\nThe formula for the area of a square is side × side. Since the sides of the square are 4 centimeters, we can calculate its area as follows:\nArea = side × side\n= 4 cm × 4 cm\n= 16 square centimeters\n\nStep 2: Set up an equation using the areas.\nSince the area of the square is equal to the area of the rectangle, we can set up the following equation:\nArea of square = Area of rectangle\n16 square centimeters = width × length\n8 cm × length = 16 square centimeters\n\nStep 3: Solve for the length of the rectangle.\nTo find the length of the rectangle, we need to isolate it in the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by the width:\nLength = Area / Width\n= 16 square centimeters / 8 cm\n= 2 centimeters\n\nStep 4: Check our answer.\nWe have found that the length of the rectangle is 2 centimeters. To check our answer, we can calculate the area of the rectangle using this length and compare it to the area of the square:\nArea = width × length\n= 8 cm × 2 cm\n= 16 square centimeters\n\nSince the areas match, we know that our answer is correct."}
{"text": "Q: John makes $60 a week from his job. He earns a raise andnow makes $70 a week. What is the % increase?\nA: To find the percentage increase, we first need to find the difference between John's new salary and his old salary.\n\nNew salary = $70\nOld salary = $60\nDifference = New salary - Old salary = $70 - $60 = $10\n\nNext, we divide the difference by the old salary to get the fraction of the original amount that was increased:\n\nFraction increased = Difference / Old salary = $10 / $60 = 1/6\n\nFinally, we multiply this fraction by 100 to convert it into a percentage. Since 1/6 is equal to approximately 0.167 or 16.67%, we can say that John's salary increased by about 17%.\n\nTherefore, the % increase in John's salary is approximately:\n\n% Increase = Fraction increased × 100 ≈ 16.67%"}
